Jeffree Your vest is ugly What are you doing
Not even joking, Jeffree Star saved my life. And I&#39;m not talking about, ok, he influenced me and follow him and blah blah blah, I&#39;m not a super fan or anything... no offense to Jeffree! I just hate TickTok, Instagram, basically any social media forms! Lol call me old fashioned. But anyways... No one should ever be mean to Jeffree! That&#39;s one bad ass person, now I haven&#39;t seen anything he&#39;s done recently and haven&#39;t been following anything he&#39;s been doing, sorry bud, but I was friends with him back in the days of MYSPACE! before anyone really knew knew who he really was, before he got so popular. I mean he was popular, of course, but not to the level he is now. And he would actually talk to me messages here and there when we just needed to get shit out. He hated to share anything... Hated to let people in, but when he does, he&#39;s the most amazing fucking person. <br>I was in a huge fight with my boyfriend one night... I had no one, I was home all alone. I logged onto MySpace, and no one was there for me when I needed to talk. They were all about their problems and their own selfishness. I sat there for for over an hour trying so hard to find someone to talk to. Finally Jeffree signed on and just wrote a message that said HEY GIRL! I broke down and said shits so hard. He said, GIRL TALK! Not even 5 mons earlier, I was about to sign off and no joke, was going to kill myself, nothing in my life was going right, my Godfather had died, my best friend passed away the week earlier too, then my boyfriend was about to leave me, and if it weren&#39;t for me just staying on for 5 more mins on that damn computer and talking to the most amazing JEFFREE in the world, I would NOT be here today. He saved my life. For an entire hour of trying to find out if all my friends to talk to and none of them wanted to talk to Me, my CLOSE SO CALLED FRIENDS! They only wanted to talk about themselves, yet Jeffree was there, and he had never let me before in person, we just messaged back and forth on Myspace, He had days where he would vent to me and I&#39;d vent to him, that&#39;s what we did. I&#39;m so upset I lost touch with him, because I never got to truly TRULY thank him for saving my life. I have a beautiful 9yr old daughter now, and even though I&#39;ve been battling bone cancer and can&#39;t work, I have nothing, and it&#39;s so so hard some days to even get through the day.  When you can&#39;t work, you have no money, and with no money, you can&#39;t live, I&#39;ve lost 50 lbs in a week because I have to make sure my daughter eats which means that I just am not able to eat sometimes, but after all that... All I have to do is look back and just remember that conversation I had with Jeffree. I&#39;m telling you. It brings me right back to the mentality of I KNOW IVE FUCKING GOT THIS! And I can&#39;t even begin to explain to you people, there is not enough words in the English language, or any language, to describe how thankful I am for JEFFREE STAR and what he has done for me. I know he will never read this but I wish so so badly that someone could get him a message from me just telling him THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MOST AMAZING YOU, AND DONT EVER CHANGE! Thank you Jeffree Star for saving my life. I know I could never repay you, because you can&#39;t possibly give anything to a person to someone whom has everything, especially when I have nothing to even give, but if I could, I would. I&#39;d give him my heart, my love and anything I could possibly give him to give him the world! <br>You&#39;re the best Jeffree and I hope one day this message finds you so you can know I truly appreciate you. Thank you!
I don&#39;t understand how someone can take such ugly such unpigmented colors and still make it look gorgeous Jeffree can literally make ANYTHING look good

Yeah, WY has 1 day of summer. It snows in July, August, ect. Good thing you get to leave whenever you want cuz that state sucks. I&#39;m assuming the no state tax is part of what attracted you tho. Could you help out the wild horses because ranchers there are the reason they&#39;re being corraled and sold off for meat cuz they don&#39;t want them grazing on their many hundreds of acres. It&#39;s disgusting

Yeah, WY has 1 day of summer. It snows in July, August, ect. Good thing you get to leave whenever you want cuz that state sucks. I&#39;m assuming the no state tax is part of what attracted you tho.

Are we not gonna talk about how beautiful James looks right now 💖💖💖😊
You look so beautiful girl !
I am a 49 year old woman. I do not ware make up often i hate the way it feels on my skin it makes me feel claustrophobic . Living in south Georgia U.S.A is another reason it is too dang hot to ware make up. I will ware a tinted gloss and a nude shadow from time to time and call it a day. Maybe when i have to renew my drivers license in 2025 i will get my make up professionally done being i do not know how to do it. He always looks beautiful and does such an amazing job . I really like his content.
Wow you have really awesome facial expression!! Also beautiful. Nice video!
Omg you’re beautiful ❤️

James u cheated for eyeshadow you used more than 1 dip because you used different colour’s
😂fEature like a blind girl dogo
Makeup to look like your face got punched in is a great look for James
Its sad seeing some popular creators grow out of doing videos, but love how james is still passionate and pulling through with such great content 💜
how about you eat purple foods or blue foods??
James, I don’t care what you say, you’re a great cook!!
you do know that tesla&#39;s have a feature on the screen that allows you to see behind you without having to look in the side mirrors you do now that write
I’m sorry about the only one who realized when she said, what size was going to be on his body for the rest of his life am I the only one who saw that I actually smudged
IF IT&#39;S SUNSCREEN WHY DID HE EAT IT AT THE START
Who&#39;s here before Benny recreate it?

The Eyeshadow one with the tissue is actually one that I&#39;ve done before 👍<br>Great hack 👍<br>And James approved apparently 👍

&quot;EEEEEEEUUHHH SO YOU THINK IM SKINNYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot;<br><br>Boiii what😭😭😭
Miclear useted to sell a water dispencer it came with miclear water and you would put a cotton pad under neath to remove your makeup they dont sell them anymore😢😢😢😢
Blood, sweat &amp; tears you say??<br><br>A<br>R<br>M<br>Y
The mistakes you make you could just make them out of a creation
“Let’s not think about her”. Even tho she CREATED the whole world and everything Harry Potter.
I just bought the whole painted set and I love it! I’ve created some awesome looks with it, and the formula is PERFECT💗
I have two Pygmy goats and all they do is eat 😂 goats have 3 stomachs so they feet very hungry 😋
Insta: iam_iyee<br>Snap: iam_iyee<br>Age: 25<br>Name: Madelene<br>I&#39;m literally about to create Twitter to follow you so I can have a  chance to win $20,000. What I&#39;m planning to do with that is to invest into real estate. It would be a dream come true and a life changing for me and my family. Best of luck to everyone
sO yOu tHiNk iM sKiNny got me laughing so hard😂😂
TREAT ME LIKE A bLIND GIRLS DOG
You&#39;re so skinny.
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
James........Im a GROWN woman.....this was HILARIOUS. Great job! (&amp;&amp; team!)
Literally going blind in my right eye too can barely function and the media is all like… more death threats!!! How sweet ❤
Only eat orange food for a day try and beat that James
James you look so orange just saying like for real I can&#39;t believe you made makeup you should do this more often but I like when you do makeup you are a great guy yep but
Pls recreate Disney movie makeup looks !!!!
At first I thought is whip cream but is sunscreen but WHY DID YOU EAT THE SUNSCREEN JAMES
✨Jamesss✨ u cant solve world hunger by EATING SO MUCH 💕💕
The One Size one performed worse than the ones rated lower. 👀
When I am to skinny to ride any wild adventure rides
One size on till dawn one wasn&#39;t as good as the other ones before that but that&#39;s just me
<b>gasp</b> &quot;so you think I&#39;m skinnYYYYYYYYYY&quot; got me dieing 💀
James: I’m either gonna be on the toilet for the whole rest of the day or die<br>Me: 🤨 being very concerned <br>Him still eating it: this slays <br>Me: you said it your self queen🪦🪦💀
I love how you’re able to make fun of yourself &amp; have fun with this campaign. Came out great
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
a petition for james to recreate this look
“Goats can spend 14 hours a day, eating. Mood hello that is me.”<br>Also james: “I’m a skinny legend”
Nickel, boat,Mary,cat,,umbrella,eat
What does he even do his make up for, or is he just at home with a full glam look?looks great though
Not his shirt looking like those heatless curlers 😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>love u james ♥
Why did you eat it james😢
When you just got braces and this pops up on your for you page and can’t eat anything that looks so good in James videos 😢
Why did James eat it
Bro.. just discovering you and I love the video, but do you breathe at all when talking lol 😅 much love❤️
“You just popped a Molly” “I’m sweatin”
What does he even do his make up for, or is he just at home with a full glam look?looks great though
size might not matter but do you know what does ? the age of consent ❤
Why did he Eat it tho😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can i ask, why you don&#39;t like magnetic lashes? I can&#39;t do normal lashes to save my life! I have tried for years, i tried magnetic and i LOVE them, so easy to use, and i wear liner every day anyway, so i can also cut them down and just have them at the end of the eye to lift my hoodes eyes, and the full lash totally covers them so i look more awake, i don&#39;t wear anything else but lip oil and lashes, and i look great! So im just curious why you don&#39;t like them? Love your channel hun 😊 hi from the uk 🇬🇧 x
I feel like kailin should have won . Cuz her idea was wayyyy more original and unique than anyone. Even tho Ashley&#39;s look was great I couldn&#39;t see any trend for it. Feeling sad for kailin
&quot;EEEEEEEUUHHH SO YOU THINK IM SKINNYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot;<br><br>Boiii what😭😭😭
All of care about is the dog like anybody with me ☺️😂
Ik it&#39;s just all the trends together but I feel like using really full coverage foundation after underpainting like defeats the purpose of it
I&#39;d eat it don&#39;t I mean DONT GET ME THIS my first thought would be SPRAY IT IN YOUR MOUTH NOW! 😂😂😂😂
It looks so good omg can I eat it
The mistakes you make you could just make them out of a creation
Bru the one size was an 11/10 when it literally smudged😂
But the real question is did he eat the SUNSCREEN <br><br>👇
I tried this and it worked great! Time to impress Kevin ❤️❤️❤️
Why does camera man james have such thick eyebrows
James: Catches whipped cream in mouth*<br>Also James: ITS SUNSCREEN <br><br><br>Me: Bro why u be eating it?
Nickel, boat,Mary,cat,,umbrella,eat
I just spotted this on Back To Hogwarts day today (9/1/23) and it is everything I needed ! Thanks for this tutorial. It inspires me to make some delicious magical treats tonight!
Size dosent matter but age does
lmao was it just me or did the caterpillar brows get thicker every time they cut to that era of james😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
Boy that make-up gloss that stops you from eating is the BEST idea I ever heard on shark tank! 🦈 I would back her company for FREE and just give her the money she needs.
I don&#39;t know the details but from what I know it was just a misunderstanding, you should all stop trying to cancel everyone and find some happiness I&#39;m your life. I&#39;m sure he felt terrible and didn&#39;t know, if he didn&#39;t, shame on him but we don&#39;t know. SO STOP HATING.
I’d eat it if my mom didn’t tell me that it was sunscreen
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
Blood, sweat &amp; tears you say??<br><br>A<br>R<br>M<br>Y
That hack is great
Bro he&#39;s asking if he looks good like was there even a question<br>  <br><br><br><br>He can pull anything off<br><br>From a dress to,sweats and oversized sweaters
But can u still eat it?
The Eyeshadow one with the tissue is actually one that I&#39;ve done before 👍<br>Great hack 👍<br>And James approved apparently 👍
The milk was better than one size the milk one didn’t much like at all
I should eat only green so you can be healthy and &quot;SKINNY&quot; 💚🍏😝
&quot;sIzE dOeS mAtTeR&quot; 💀💀💀💀💀
I can’t even do makeup 💄 with my eyes open let alone closed
OMG I LOVE THIS ADD SMMM GREAT JOB JAMES
Why did you eat it💀💀💀💀💀
I saw the video you treat the girl bad<br>You should be ashamed
Wonderful Video James Charles And Crew!  Everything James Charles And His Crew Create Turns Into Gold!  Who sings the song Between 24 secs and 27 secs into the video?
Not his shirt looking like those heatless curlers 😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>love u james ♥
Oml you look great if I did this I would look like I tried and hit my head on a rock and as I got up ended up slipping face first into mud
You are a great singer slayyy
Size matters thats why you dont get importance
You gave the one size and 11/10... even tho it literally smeared worse than the product before. You might not do sponsors, but you&#39;re definitely biased
Hopefully, you have a great day 😊😊😊😊😊❤😂😂
Just came from James&#39;s IG story renting out a theatre to watch Hunger Games where the theatre also showed this very commercial of the painted palette instead of the regular previews --- and I just wanted to say that I&#39;m sorry for being 2 weeks late to this masterpiece!! The content, the delivery , the promotion.... Perfect!
I was about to go to the store and buy came to eat it😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The foundation at first was giving Flashback Mary but it turned out gorge, thanks for the great content once again!
Its scary how easily the world forgets... Shame on ya&#39;ll
Okay but I LOVE THIS! Self awareness, satire, self promo, and most of all, it’s not not ground breaking, it’s close to the heart. Will be adding to my collection.
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
Bro.. just discovering you and I love the video, but do you breathe at all when talking lol 😅 much love❤️
plus: retro-Royalties
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
J.  is just naturally beautiful  his facial features are so unique.   I love how He is making us feel  like we all are on line chatting with him    I think he is doing exactly was he is meant to do  .  He is classy  and funny  just the type of person  I so would hang out with   Jeff is our ROCK STAR for sure   I cheer up when I watch his channel..  Refreshing  STAY U Sir Jeffreeeee 😊
y&#39;all Jeffree with eyebrows scared me- my body wasn&#39;t prepared
Omg that is horrible. Hope your lashes were ok. That stuff looked unsafe. Hope you managed to rinse and repeat it away
Eating Oreos while watching you
I literally can’t stop staring at your sweater 😍
it&#39;s funny cuz the cheapest natural highlighter is just sweat...
Eat pink food for one day😂
That sweater though 😍
Give that weight loss gloss and a gym sis
Bad weather and roads in grand forks ND too. Working for a delivery company over the holidays is insane for us. Over 20k packages behind lol
As she&#39;s telling everybody to not go after Jeffrey, while in the same sentence,  calling out his flaws. She&#39;s such a phony.
When I am to skinny to ride any wild adventure rides
Your teeth look fab!  So white &amp;beautiful also the makeup looks great on you....I have to say I&#39;m definitely more daring w my eyeshadow colors becoz of you!!!  Also u always pick up my sad mood when I&#39;m feeling debby downer...keep it up love!  Your a doll
I have Eczema on my eyes and face sometimes when I do my makeup it’s looks so dry that sometimes I can’t even wear makeup without it looking so dry and gross
I’m shocked he liked these products at all because I work in a makeup store and I HATE the it products. He might’ve only like it because he could afford to not have a single pore and perfect skin. The guest I try the cc cream on are regular ppl that can’t afford laser treatments and it separates on them and looks cakey. I’m always so confused when people say they love it bc all I could see is the way it separates on their skin but 🤷🏽‍♀️
If it wasn’t sunscreen I would eat it 😅
Man , they look so good 😋<br>How unlucky i am that I won&#39;t be able to eat that 🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭
IT LOOKS SO PRETTY ON YOU, YOU REALLY CREATED A PRETTY LOOK!!! BUT CMON U ARE ALSO STUNNING!!
I think Jeffree should do a Hot Topic collab. Their makeup isn&#39;t great and it would be a throwback to his merch from the myspace days.
elf is like the nerd with full-on ideas but nobody really supports it (them, she, he)
One size on till dawn one wasn&#39;t as good as the other ones before that but that&#39;s just me
Nobody notice how he accidentally said foundation instead of concealer
Watching Jeffery high asf at 2 in the morning eating a banana pudding milkshake is a vibe🧚🏾🤍💭☁️
Its scary how easily the world forgets... Shame on ya&#39;ll
“You just popped a Molly” “I’m sweatin”
Wonderful Video James Charles And Crew!  Everything James Charles And His Crew Create Turns Into Gold!  Who sings the song Between 24 secs and 27 secs into the video?
That make up looks great! ❤
You&#39;re so skinny.
Jeffrey: Who watches YouTube and eats popcorn? <br>Me:as I stuff my mouth with a hand full of popcorn 🤣
Recomended after the corona thing? Anybody?
I love how he doesn&#39;t judge any makeup until he actually tries it and he compliments makeup that is cheaper because not everyone can afford the top of the line makeup . That&#39;s great because I&#39;m guessing there are many fans that can only afford more affordable brands. It would be cool if she subscribed to boxycharm or ipsy and do try one with the makeup that many of us get to try only in sub boxes
Hi girl can you maybe review beauty creation cosmetics in the future please I would love it so much.
I love how she closes one lid with the other one not twitching.
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
Thick moisturiser pretty much does the same as this 😂
Pls recreate Disney movie makeup looks !!!!
a good dupe to this tatcha moisturiser is the neutrogena hydro boost gel moisturiser! great for any skin type! it has stayed my top favorite for years :)
Okay but I LOVE THIS! Self awareness, satire, self promo, and most of all, it’s not not ground breaking, it’s close to the heart. Will be adding to my collection.
Elf is a good makeup for the price ..you can’t beat it
Close ur eyes nd listen to it
Size doesn’t matter No it’s not giving
The short hair looks so much better on Jeffree. His face comes into its own much more. He looks great with long hair or a wig, of course, but with short hair he doesn&#39;t look so dramatically moderate and looks more likeable. This hairstyle reflects his true inner self. Just nice and normal. I hope you don&#39;t get me wrong 😊 I like Jeffree&#39;s way. I love how honest he is, no matter who is behind the makeup brand. I&#39;ve only been watching his videos for a short time. Of course, I&#39;ve known him for a long time, but had never really seen his videos. I find him sympathetic.. I have no idea what kind of drama there was with Him, and I don&#39;t care. I also know that many have canceled jeffree, but have no idea why ^^
I should eat only green so you can be healthy and &quot;SKINNY&quot; 💚🍏😝
Gurl I had eaebuds in &quot;SKINNY&quot; 😂😅
Bro go eat A-
your so ugly
&quot;EEEEEEEUUHHH SO YOU THINK IM SKINNYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot;<br><br>Boiii what😭😭😭
or you can just open the can and drink. open the bottle and drink. i admire the creativity though 10/10
Great video, more usefull info 8 minutes than I&#39;ve learned in a lifetime
I was obese , but nowhere even close to these people, but I was conscious that I needed to lose weight at the age of 58.<br>My problem was binge eating late at night.<br>I went and had a blood test and thankfully no problems.<br>I went on to the carnivore diet as did my wife and it&#39;s been amazing.<br>See have both had steady weight loss, better sleep and so much energy.<br>We swim for 1 hour every day and feel as if we were in our 20&#39;s.<br>Our mantra is &quot;Nothing tastes as good as thin feels&quot;
this is so wild! great video
I remember this episode, especially once that father guy said he&#39;s from Poland therefore he knows all about the mushrooms. Now I see his wife shares that belief.<br>As a Polish person I swear I don&#39;t have a clue what they mean. Of course we have mushrooms in Poland but they are not especially important to most traditional (or &quot;traditional passing&quot;) recipes. I&#39;m also surprised by the lack of Polish accent?
Shame jojo is like the only one who still talks to het
Serena 😍 Great content!
God forbid children are gonna have fun when they are trying to lose weight
your so ugly
I actually disagree with a lot of this.  Filters aside, these women these girls are crying over are putting in work these girls are not putting in.  They have their hair done, they have their makeup on, they&#39;re watching their nutrition, they&#39;re working out, they&#39;re dressing carefully, and - yes - they&#39;re probably under a filter or two.  These girls are just crying.  They&#39;re not even wearing any makeup.  I&#39;m not saying women MUST wear makeup to be beautiful, but if you want to look like the women wearing tons of makeup, you&#39;re going to have to put some on.  Even they don&#39;t look the way they do wearing makeup when they&#39;re not wearing makeup.  You&#39;re not going to get the same results if you&#39;re not putting in any of the effort.  Most blatant example, the significantly overweight girl in the opening hugging herself as the audio plays something like &quot;I wish I knew what it was like to be seen as beautiful.&quot;  Fix your nutrition. That&#39;s all you.  No, don&#39;t run off half-cocked, develop an eating disorder, recover, and come back claiming all nutrition management efforts are toxic diet culture.  Do it right.  You can&#39;t expect the same results when you&#39;re not putting in the same efforts. Aspirational is but should not be a four letter word.  Either legitimately strive - no crash diets, shortcuts, or other bullshit - to be what you want to be or accept how you are without insisting others do too.  Sorry, BP - body positivity - obesity will never cute, for example.  Lets stop this headlong run for a &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;-style society.
Let that individual go home and treat himself...no one sees that the man is sick and suffering<br>Now I understand better..woke means that cowardly and worthless character, who blames the past to be able to do whatever the rot in him wants...
I loved watching this!  Great relationship and wonderful family!
You are absolutely so real and awesome. Thank you for everything your love for make up your life for your animals your love for the great outdoors. You are entirely my favorite Shirley Katherine in  Phoenix.
Many people do not understand carbs. Carbs are also some kind of sugar, so you should avoid them and rather eat complex carbs than simple ones. Best is doing sports and eat lots of proteins to gain muscles. More muscles, more energy you need, if you eat less than you need, you lose weight. Also just eat 2 times a day, to keep insolin level low, which is important to lose weight.
Is anybody else here after seeing &quot;sucking d and c&quot; 😂😂
I’m new and yet I’m subbed.GREAT JOB!
Always we have options and choices,  do not blame food companies, do not buy and don&#39;t eat, if we r fat it us over fault.
fun fact amy is even slimmer now but tammy is still very obese
I appreciate that emphasized that Schenee is exhibiting behaviors that we all have plenty of experience with. You&#39;re not talking about her as if she is impossible to relate to, even to the extent of explaining her cruel treatment of her husband as a symptom of her denial. Very classy way of presenting the subject matter.
people mistake emotions as a part of physical health. All because you value yourself now and don&#39;t put all your worth on weight and looks, doesnt mean you should spiral into an eating disorder of the opposite. It&#39;s still an eating disorder. It&#39;s still killing you quicker than a normal human.
the biggest thing to stop eating so much junk food is realising that it doesnt even actually taste good
Deep discount of $25000!!! Ha ha ha.<br>The irony is that eating a diet very, very high in plants, and the benefits of glutathione ARE there. But loads of coffee enemas, and losing weight by dehydration??? Just chuck out the processed crap, eat more plants (with the fibre still in), and drink enough water…. I can promise you, you WILL get healthier. <br>Thanks. You can send your few thousands dollars to me at….
Does not want is face associated with his beliefs and stance - what a first class moron - hope he has GREAT trouble finding anyone to employ him.  All those people like him are ripe for hell. 🇬🇧🇮🇱✡️✝️
Great interview lovely women
I think, and I could very well be wrong is this is a bunch of saber rattling by China and creating an enemy out of the US. Xi is trying to get an unprecedented third term and what better way to rile up the votes than to push reunification (which got him elected the first go around) and to focus everyone on a common enemy, the US. China has tried to take back Taiwan like two or three times already and has failed each time and honestly with their banks already imploding I don’t think they could sustain any kind of long engagement short of bombing the sh!t out of everything.
By law you aren&#39;t even allowed to shoot for TV within a real restaurant that is being used by people who didn&#39;t approve anything.<br>Not only that, how many times does it happen that these restaurants sell pure trash but people keep coming?<br>Remember what adults told you back in the day, they wer right, EVERYTHING ON TV IS FAKE.<br>Same for youtube these days, everything behind a person is a add and nobody is gonna make a movie without having thought about that.<br>It is not just all over the top, it is so far over the top that it just becomes obvious how fake it is.
I was chubby as a child, imagine going to fat camp, and then realized, &quot;bruh i can literally lose weight myself&quot;
I&#39;m a natural kinda woman. The loud make-up doesn&#39;t work for me like the natural look doesn&#39;t work for others. I think you look great. 😁
Yes as a parent I have full control over what my child eats because I’m the one buying the food. It’s as simple as that. <br>I buy food and he has no choice but to eat what I’ve brought for him.

Wow - Noor is absolutely fascinating! What a smart,  inspirational young woman! This was a great interview!
Never forget Elaine Welteroth revived Vogue Teens out of fashion death and made it relevant to young Gen Z, love her trailblazing a$$ in the fashion/editorial world. Just watch her interview here, literally creating a title for herself as an intern and negotiating a salary on her own - talk about manifesting exactly what you want out of life.
I know this may fly in the face of the video but - Do they have a &quot;Skinny Camp&quot;. I&#39;M NOT KIDDING. My whole life I&#39;ve been underweight. My parents are scared for me. I USED TO try justify it as &quot;Oh but at least I&#39;m not fat...&quot;<br><br>But now I wonder if it could be just as bad as being fat (NOT OBESE though. I&#39;m well aware obesity is still worse). But the lock of Iron and Protein in my body had my doctors concerned. ESPECIALLY my neurologist because she warned my low iron in my blood could actually reduce the effectiveness of my seizure medication.<br><br>Recently I HAVE had a protein increase (and NOT via an expensive protein shake) but...NOW I&#39;m reading how all these oils in peanut butter ain&#39;t so good. I work from home so this past year finally started cooked FROZEN food (But oven food not microwave) so I have to watch my salt but...No issues yet .<br><br>BAH! THE THING IS I WON&#39;T LISTEN TO A NUTRITIONIST! (I WILL listen to my neurologist above the Vitamin D and Calcium pills though because I REFUSE the stop skiing and don&#39;t plan on losing my bones any time soon...)<br><br>EDIT: It is NOT my family&#39;s fault. They ALWAYS offer up whatever fresh meal they made. And recently I&#39;ve actually STARTED JOINING THEM since I work 3rd shift at home...
What a waste of money and the styles are just ugly.. you always make me laugh so much.. ❤️
I am a really lazy person when it comes to cooking. I am single and always buy food from restaurants. But since I got an air fryer I cook my meals literally in 20 min. No cooking skills required and countless recipes can be found online. Combining with physical exercise (weightlifting and little bit of cardio) and avoiding processed food and sugar as much as possible,  I managed to drop my weight from 190lbs to 176lbs in just 6 weeks. I feel so great, lighter and more energetic now. ❤
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
Tati what do you think of Catrice?  I&#39;ve heard that they and Essence are run by the same parent company.  I love Essence and have heard great things about Catrice as well, but Catrice is harder to find and purchase in Canada....
Secret eating was a hurdle I had to seriously overcome to push past my plateau at 200lb😅
I’m living for that sweater
This was phenomenal! It’s crazy watching this movie 30 years! I remember when the first one came out 😁 it was a phenomenal movie in it’s time and Tom did a great job!
I get why adults try to encourage children to try new foods, it is good for them to do so, but I will never understand why they attempt to force feed foods that are already known to make the child gag. All it does is create a bad memory in the best possible scenario, or an aversion, and maybe even a phobia, in the worst case. <br><br>My mom did the same thing with me and fish (in my case, orange roughy, not even deliciously cooked, but STEAMED, with no seasoning other than a little margarine. I was made to sit at the table for hours, choking it down as if it was a punishment. I even remember my mom seeming mad at me, which makes no sense to me as an adult. I&#39;m 34 now, and only over the last five years or so have I worked up the courage to try new seafoods that are actually well prepared. I even love sushi now, but for years, I was afraid to try it, thinking I might gag.
Diet soft drink are yucky, aspartame is very toxic and dangerous,  it causes cancer and eats holes in your brain
It might be cool to see a video where Tati goes through each skin care claim and why we want those products removed from our products (ie sulfate free, why don’t we want sulfate in products). Just a thought but love these new kind of video,  very informative!
Eat a fruit and you’ll be fine ❤
When it comes to inauthenticity I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d start with Heather Mills.
if they kill bond its close case for james bond movies 007 is dead you kill the character no more movies if they make the next with the black woman its going to be a bud light moment game over go woke go broke crash an burn shame because i really liked james bond its a british thing i guess you get any one else play the part then its not james bond anymore its james broken
I loved this show deep into my struggle with anorexia... I was so jealous that the people got to look at the food tube thing to see how little they were eating...
🤢.<br>I&#39;m glad I stopped eating that shit years n&#39; years ago!<br>When I was young I could eat a ton of it.<br>Now in my 40&#39;s I feel sick when I eat even a little of it.<br>It&#39;s pure 💩.
The second fast food kid is fat because both her parents are fat.
DC was the worst Bond for me, so I felt it hard to dredge up any emotion for him as the missiles came over. His expression reminded me of those turtle head characters, can&#39;t recall their name. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the Bond girl either - she seemed weak, acting was fairly wooden, didn&#39;t feel any chemistry between her and Bond, Vesper was much more attractive and engaging. Even though we watched this in the theatre, I was bored. The doctor character was annoying, as you say, the plot holes ruined the story line, we normally need to suspend disbelief in these movies, and get swept along with the action, but when one is thinking to yourself, what the heck just happened, it mars the continuity. Overcoming the nanobots was never explored, what was the point of the watch?
🧡🖤 I STILL HAVE MY PALETTE BUT I DON&#39;T USE IT AS MUCH BECAUSE I DON&#39;T WANT TO RUN OUT I&#39;VE ALREADY HIT PAN ON JUST A FEW COLORS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND I HOPE YOU CAN COME OUT WITH SOME MORE PELLETS IN THE FUTURE I HOLD ON TO MINE LIKE IT&#39;S GLASS AND FRAGILE I DON&#39;T WANT ANYTHING HAPPENING TO IT NO DUPE IS GOING TO RECREATE THIS MASTERPIECE YOU HAVE 🖤🧡
It was a great pallet!! It’s one of my favorites 💕💕
Very interesting to see a wh*te woman wag her finger at these beautiful strong bipoc kings and queens. Fat shaming is very much alive, and this “documentary” proves it.
This video was just interrupted by that tool who says carbs and donuts don’t make you fat. Weird.
Why would I want to eat poison masquerading as food?
Excellent clip! You managed to pack in (or perhaps A &amp; F did) more cringe than I thought possible in a non true crime video. Great channel by the way!
58 looks like 78 😢😢 overweight so bad
If somebody loses weight on this crazy diet, they certainly will lose water and muscles
Must be nice to be so care free, meanwhile I&#39;m sitting here worrying about how I&#39;m paying all my bills and eat while working just a full time job
You’re one of my comfort YouTubers so I keep rewatching these videos over time. I didn’t realize it the first time watching, but now I can see that it’s so obvious that something similar was going on with my ex best friend and me. The way Tammy speaks reminds me so much of her suddenly and especially the way she speaks about Amy is kinda similar to how this „friend“ spoke about me. <br>In my case it wasn’t about weight loss but about psychological issues and how one handles their trauma. It always kinda felt like a competition, like who had the worst trauma, who was the bigger victim… she openly told me she was jealous of me many times and also how my trauma must not have been as bad as hers or else I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish the things I have. (Which, I don’t have an amazing life with tons of accomplishments. I struggle with depression and everyday is a fight for survival sometimes, but I’m not gonna give up on life and work really hard to maintain a somewhat hopeful mindset and I’m really grateful to still be here) she always blamed someone or something else for her failures, even when it was absolutely clear, that sometimes it was just the consequences of her behavior and she felt entitled to everything cause she had it so hard and everyone was out to get her, supposedly. It really hurt, seeing my friend so unhappy and I was trying everything to be supportive but I struggle with my own issues and have a limited capacity. When I told her this, she completely exploded and to this day is convinced that I am/was actively trying to sabotage her.<br>But somehow it makes sense now why she is that way. Im glad to have herbeizubringende my life but I don’t hate her and I really wish her all the best and hopefully one day she will be able to self reflect about her behavior and create a happier life for herself.
No need for scientific reasons. Water is fluid,which makes your body and brain more fluid. Its that simple. So drink all you can all day everyday.
I personally know three people that’s had this surgery, sadly after a few years all three gained the weight back.
anorexia nervosa is one of the most evil conditions that there is.  This woman&#39;s crass hijacking of the disease is disgusting.  She is disgusting (inside and out)
You&#39;re putting things way too kindly Ben. Everybody pays not only their fair share to the great leviathan, but much more than that. The government extorts people&#39;s money and spend it in whatever the fuck they want, they&#39;re only held (barely) accountable every 4 years.
Ok, OK, ok °^° HE LOOKS GREAT WITHOUT EYEBROWS <br>Holy moly wooo crazy
What a brilliant mind, you can make america great.. I would vote for you, no second thoughts, and im not even an american
I hope you would make video on intermittent fasting in the future and it&#39;s benefits in loosing weight
I&#39;m 14 years old and trying to loose weight so I can fit into some clothes I have and I&#39;m trying to achieve a slimmer body for the asthetic. I&#39;m 9 stone and 12 lbs. I really appreciate you and this channel, it&#39;s helped a lot.
I’m sorry if someone already said this… I love PTR products, but you have to use very specific makeup with it. Angie Hot and Flashy did a great review on the product and what to avoid. Take care!
you can buy all those brushes from elf for like 50-75$. And theyre great quality.
Recreate this look with your favorites!!!!
No more animal fats.
Living with diabetes can trigger more eating and super high blood sugar levels 😮her sugars are probably 450 up
The mistakes you make you could just make them out of a creation
It would be great if you did a second one same but higher end, I loved this idea.
The petite botany scully kneel because court anaerobically haunt underneath a embarrassed chef. busy, bloody chive
So I work in food service. In a franchise that specializes in sugary soft serve treats. Yes the manufacturers are participating in shrinkflation. But, we’ve had a sugar shortage. We’ve had unions strike in plants that make these treats. So it’s well beyond just corporate greed. I have not been able to get candy toppings here and there since the middle of last year. There are many factors here that actually make it so the corporations can profit. And the smarties package. You can tell they unwrapped, took a few out, then rewrapped. Please be careful with what’s used to show the problem.
I also changed up my diet and eating habits in February this year. I had been gaining and getting to the fattest point in my life (relatively fat, my BMI was just on the lower end of Overweight). I started intermittent fasting and doing strength resistance exercises 15 min a day before breakfast. Lost 20lbs so far and it&#39;s steady now. My clothes are getting looser still even though the number on the scale hasn&#39;t really changed 😊 My pants size has gone from &quot;not fitting into 32&quot; to &quot;easily fitting into 28.&quot; It&#39;s all about routine and perseverance. No miracle cure for most people without certain medical problems like thyroid or whatever
He gave himself a real eating disorder. He ded
Caught that sweatshirt 💪💪 amen
I have loved you before but I often thought that you don&#39;t look all that happy. I don&#39;t know I felt like all the makeup and people and PR and the amount of work, you were desperately trying to fill up a hole and you cared so much about what others thought, even people who absolutely weren&#39;t worth it.<br><br>Now when I watch you I sense that you&#39;re having fun and that makes watching your videos much more chill and I&#39;m so glad to see you grow and live your life for you and for others but still share it with us.<br><br>Somehow when you share the real you with us, it feels so much more precious than when you were putting up a show. It was great, too, but one could really see the built up stress right under the surface.
I agree you can do what you want with your body as long as you do not harm or kill someone else. I can choose to swing my arm around but if assault someone with it. It is wrong. The very act of abortion is to harm and kill someone else. Another body. The abortion allows someone to refuse responsibility for their choices.
Anna Richardson has done some interesting shows with educational content, like this and Secret Eaters. Even Naked Attraction, as silly as the premise of the show is, has some fun facts sprinkled in here and there. It&#39;s good to see her presenting a show with a more serious tone (even if it was from before Naked Attraction, which was my introduction to her)
the fact that half the comments are in what i think is finnish, is just, great
People who leave mean comments need to look in the mirror and ask themselves why it bothers them so much what other people do with THEIR body 🤔 People NEED to chill out and stop judging others
Is that why you fired Candice Owens? Bible verses about peace is too much diversity for you? What is it you say?…Facts don’t care about your feelings? Educate yourself first on Israel’s complicity on both creating and funding Hamas to purposely sew division among the Palestinians… I’m not condoning the atrocities that were committed heinous as the were but for Israel to then commit the same acts of genocide ….well doesn’t that leave the whole world blind?
People confuse the traits of a narcissist way too often with the traits of BPD or with plain old overcorrection of extremely low confidence.<br>She hates herself. When she says she’s great and all, all she’s doing is trying to convince herself. You can tell she doesn’t like herself at all. In fact, she dislikes herself so much that she’s already confident beforehand that she’ll fail at losing weight.
Jeffree you look great with eyebrows. Without, you look like you are sick with Cancer. It really makes you look unhealthy. As always, you make me laugh so hard. You&#39;re like a bad addiction, but in a good way. You make me feel like I&#39;m a kid playing with toys. I live for these moments.
I’m confused. Didn’t Google make their employees fat in the first place? Then they changed things so the employees just lost the weight that Google caused them to gain?
I was 185 lbs. My aim is to reduce my weight to 154 lbs. I am currently at 170 lbs and it&#39;s becoming really hard for me to lose further weight even after eating less calories per day
I am a med student and we study so much about how obesity is a risk factor for numerous diseases, focusing on mechanisms of how being obese specifically affect different organ system. I cannot fathom how this person is a doctor and still chose to overlook all that researched information?
I&#39;m gonna be so honest, seeing fat babies really pisses me off. Like these parents don&#39;t give a literal fuck about their babies. These kids haven&#39;t had a choice
You wanna talk about chair issues, try being left handed and sitting in those school chair-desk combos made for right handed people. The amount of times I tried to stand up by getting out on the left side, and then biffing it in front of the class 😂 I&#39;m overweight, mainly due to my own admitted laziness, and I don&#39;t fit into the chairs at my dentist. I just laugh and say my fat ass doesn&#39;t fit in their chair, so give me a moment while I try think skinny lol It&#39;s gonna be ok. I&#39;m gonna be ok if I don&#39;t fit in the chair or if a desk is the wrong way for me. There are bigger problems to worry about in life that need legitimate attention. 🤦‍♀️
Boy that make-up gloss that stops you from eating is the BEST idea I ever heard on shark tank! 🦈 I would back her company for FREE and just give her the money she needs.
6I&#39;m now wondering if I&#39;m using the wrong brush- Because I have that same cream-to-powder blush and I CANNOT get it on my brush without  REALLY getting my brush in there and swirling it around. My brush has a really hard time picking it up for some reason<br>Also I would rather have teeny brows like her than have my GIANT blocky thick brows LMAOO
Again I don’t think it’s a skinny world I think Hollywood ski place but you guys are normal every day women I don’t understand why this is so crazy but I think it would be hard being in Hollywood and being my size which is a size 8/10
The best things that work for me are:<br>Have a good breakfast (I try to eat healthy but quite sweet breakfast such as oatmeal with nuts and fruits or an oat-banana pancake with homemade peanut butter. That keeps cravings away)<br>Lunch with a green salad as first course <br>Very light dinner such as cooked veggies or papaya and yogurt<br>And mostly: AVOID EATING BETWEEN MEALS. If I have even an innocent treat, it could trigger binge eating. So I don&#39;t do it anymore.
Where did you get your sweater?
There is nothing attractive about fat.
im watching The Critical Drinker since he started on youtube...great guy
Ashley looks like she has lost a lot of weight
I know respect opossums becuse they eat a crazy amount of ticks every year
Ur fukin AWESOME 👏 ❤ LOVE UR REALNESS N U DO A GREAT VID ON MAKE UP U LOOK FABULOUS❤
I know three people who need to go to fat camp and two of them are my best friend 🗿
Has Ben ever ran for any political office. His views match my own he&#39;s definitely very intelligent and would greatly serve our country
I will say i do usually prefer that they use actors and actresses that accurately represent the roles they are playing (white actresses playing white queens and vice versa etc) but the actress who played queen Charlotte in the netflix series was absolutely phenomenal and it was a great show. Also, the whole show is only about 60-70% historical accurate anyway, due to embellishments and the such to mock it up to a theatrical form
Color stay Foundation 🙌⬇️🔥🔥Now the formula depends on you. I have dry skin all year around and I can use both formulas (Summertime I sweat… so that’s my Sweatproof Summer Foundation) <br><br>Physicians Formula lip glosses is really.. About the price. If you can afford it get it. It’s pretty much Mehh ( pigment, hydrating, lasting ) BUT WHAT CHEAPER LIP GLOSS CANT DO THAT. <br><br>I love the face and eyes Tati

Good Job!  The movie was terrific and soooooo needed  for America. I would bet the Death Star run idea came from the canyon flying the military does. The military has been doing low level  canyon training for 50 years plus, some of it through the hills around the L.A. basin.
OH MY GOD!!!! EVERY TIME I SEE THESE COMMENTS  I ALWAYS SEE THAT HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO LOOKS GREAT WITHOUT EYEBROWS!!! YES, HE /SHE DOES LOOK GOOD. FUCK!!!!!
Another great video! We appreciate all the time and effort you put into your videos
Hey, I’m a 32 year old guy and I check my backseat when I get in. Some people just wanna do bad things to whoever
It doesn&#39;t help that many fast food chains have taken anything that was even remotely healthy off of their menus. Why is grilled chicken no longer a choice? It is only fried! I actually prefer grilled. I also do actually like eating salads but those are also gone from many menus. Not offering healthier options should not be ok! Especially when they used to! It really pisses me off.
such a great interview!!! love both of your voices
As a Canadian, 2hrs is short... you drive 10hrs for something and it&#39;s great cus you can make it back in the same day 😭
10 days for the Premiere from the Album: &quot;Treat Myself&quot;👍❤<br>Meghan trainor 😍
This is the definition of disgusting
I am sure that the BP movement was more about disfigurement, differences and disabilities when it first came about. The obese co opted it and then complain and cut people out. Mental
So much support for Taiwan was passed over. Being a key democratic country in the first island chain, plus Japan, South Korea, the Uk, Canada, India, Australia and others all opposing the taking of Taiwan. The Quad...That&#39;s a lot of support. How much support does China have? Allies? They have 17 to 19 border disputes and lose to one, India, every time. China is not a dragon. It&#39;s a peacock.
Love him or hate him this guy has an amazing eye for seeing great talents and managing them well!!
This is so disgusting to watch they call Jesus non binary, Jesus is gay... In muslims we believe Jesus also called as Isaa alaihasalam is Allah&#39;s Prophet , we being a muslim never ever make fun of him and these people are derange ... This is Sad !!!
Research History? This has all been done before. History REPEATS itself.
Try applying the same foods for vegans or vegetarians by removing all the meats, like the beef, fish or chicken.
white rice is not junk food. It&#39;s the healthiest food and eaten by all Asians who are slimmer than White people.
Ashley is a wonderful host! So natural and no phony stupid questions. Like a real person having a real conversation! I have to be honest. I did not care for Christian on PR. Just was not my thing and he was young and way too full of himself. HOWEVER, as he has matured and his inclusion of all women of all shapes, sizes, colors etc. has won my heart. I now look at other collections and ask why aren&#39;t they doing what Christian just did??!!
Sugar, carbs, Sodium - that leads to obesity...I eat mostly bell peppers, onions, cucumbers, mushrooms, apples, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, drink water and coffee black. Thinner in my late 40s than my early 20s when I ate garbage. It&#39;s all diet and exercise. How much do you think a meal like that costs? Less than $5 a day.
Fat. Overweight people mock people for every thing but calling an obese person fat is mean and ugly but they call us the skinny chick or beautiful chick and I  say  fat chick I&#39;m  even considered racist against unhealthy obesity
I used to be a fat person. I was about 330 pounds.<br><br>I got tired of being sick, so I got serious about it and three years ago start losing weight <br><br>Today I’m 220 pounds and when I tell you, it’s a world of difference I mean it’s a freaking world of difference <br><br>I would never hate on fat people because I understand what they’re going through but it is a choice and they need to understand. Some people are making a better choice than them and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Great is greener on the other side
Great video tati
i feel like i start binge eating when my parents out of home or when i am far from them. I dont know why exactly
I lost 40 pounds in two weeks. it&#39;s simple cut your food intake down. I ate two meals a day, meat, salads and exercise.
I use to get jack in the box once a week, same thing, love it, like 10 years straight. No weeks off. Did a diet, lost a bunch of weight. Went on a road trip and stopped to get that same meal. It was about noon. Hadn’t had it in like 7 months. Got on the road about 30 minutes later, I felt like I was gonna fall asleep. The crash was always scary. Don’t think I’ve had that meal since, maybe 9 years ago. 😊
anyone think the oc creator was being sarcastic, perhaps 🤔
Great Stuff
This is one of the most eye-opening and impactful videos I&#39;ve ever seen - I think its so easy to give in to quick calorie foods but recognising the incredible value of low calorie to high nutrition ratio foods in improving all aspects of your health (strength, immune system, brain function, etc) and literally extending your lifespan completely changes how I think of food now. Thank you so much Kiana for creating these amazingly informative and brilliantly designed videos!
I just bought the whole painted set and I love it! I’ve created some awesome looks with it, and the formula is PERFECT💗
Such hideous people......disgusting
I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m constantly surprised when people fall for stuff like this.  Just the headline alone would cause me to scroll right past it knowing there would be no actual benefit to it yet people not only buy the book but advertise it on national television as this &quot;miracle diet&quot; as a cash grab.  This book still has 4 stars on amazon over almost 800 reviews so the overwhelming majority still recommend this book.  Why people would rather buy into this rather than look into actual scientific data for weight loss is beyond me.
It just blows my mind how so-called “professional” individuals were actually okay with threatened violence
The poorest ppl  in America are the fattest. No one is starving here!
I love how honest they are!! <br>I do think being yourself as much as possible is the most important thing...as there is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution. <br>Love - Gratitude and Never Giving Up are super important.<br>Thank you both!
If they enjoy eating these weird ass things, it&#39;s more like oral fixation and stimulation that gives them pleasure.
On the other side, you have youtubers who, just by mere curiosity, go 3+ days without eating and say they feel better than ever. Humans are such strange creatures.
As a 14 year old girl that lost 20kg (from 80-60) in the last 4,5 months I find your videos could be very helpfull. I sadly found your channel after I already got my stuff together. It started because I was doing research and a project on personality, that helped me become more open minded and started analyzing my behavior- I found out that my over eating stemmed from the fact that I was just sad,bored and playing video games all day. Luckily this “enlightening “ happened just before summer break so I could put my full effort into loosing weight. I first started with getting myself busy and being productive ( I personally feel a lot happier and emotionally “satiated” when I’ve had a productive day and can go exhausted to bed) so I was helping my dad construct our house all the time except when I had to eat (switched my old stuff for low calorie high volume food ) and also I started playing tennis every other day so I had 700-900 active calories daily. When school started it first didn’t really impact me, just switched out construction work to studying more (sadly my active calories dropped😢) but I’ve recently had a little bump in the road- I got sick, so no tennis but this was still ok cause I was putting all my energy this week into a biology seminar, next week I went to school but still no tennis but still working on seminar but I started eating really poorly for like 3 weeks and gained 2 kg, but I got it under control and already lost those 2kg back. Also I started going to the gym with my friend half a week ago ( i think it’s gonna substitute tennis because it’s getting cold and tennis is really expensive tbh and I don’t think I can suport tennis, gym and getting good grades and placing in competitions )
Nothing easier than a simple leg death lift, butw this whale is sweating 😂😂
Tbh my fave places to hand out stuff on Halloween-- if not full size candies-- were the ones giving out stupid little toys and pencils and shit like that. Anything Halloween themed has been a fave growing up so it gave me a spooky toy or usable thing for year &#39;round!
I haven&#39;t been your size since I was 12. <br>Her at 12... 375lbs.....
I don&#39;t  know if you need to hear this<br>But you beautiful girl <br>You deserve greatness. <br>Just saying
If simple carbohydrates are not very good for a diet, does anyone know if fats like butter, milk, cheese are okay in moderation? Or would it be best to avoid them as well?
Love Sophia! Such a classy, intelligent, beautiful role model. Ashley is also a such great interviewer, she genuinely listens to the guests which most don’t!
GoD Is GoOD GoD Is gREaT
Does the baby has any health risks while developing in such fat woman?
The funny thing is, his mindset was probably programmed into him by a previous (or current) wh*re girlfriend a who wants to cheat all the time without consequences. Thus, he’s a beta male.
The funny thing is that the one guy tried to call out, Ben&#39;s hypocrisy while showing his own Hypocrisy.   Lol. If everyone has the right to feel &quot;comfortable in their own skin&quot;... Why do these women athletes not have the right to have their own private bathrooms and openly speak about it without being considered transphobic?  Or just women&#39;s bathrooms in general like at gyms and spas... If it&#39;s a free country, why are we denying the rights of women? We are basically treating them like they don&#39;t matter.  Seems like instead of saying &quot;trans rights are human rights&quot;.... We need to be saying &quot;women&#39;s rights are human rights.&quot;
I CANNOT with the nails-anything in public!! I work in an office and i can hear my boss clipping his nails in his office next to me and then i hear my mom (she works with me) in her cubicle filing hers and it sounds like someone is sanding wood to me. My father in law carries little clippers in his pocket and pulls them out and trims away like sitting on our couch or standing in the kitchen and i just have to leave the room and clean extra later (my in laws are otherwise super lovely so i bite my tongue on this). 😳🙈🙉🤢
The beatboxing❤️🔥
She is a disgusting human being! Activists like this should never hold office!
The whole family needs to go on a diet.   They&#39;re all obese and the sad part is they&#39;re calling each other out on their weight.   I can&#39;t
I&#39;ve lost 90 lbs and I feel so much better but right now I&#39;m struggling to lose the last 10 and wanting to eat for emotional comfort. I just want to eat and feel better, not feel so sad and angry. Eating was how I coped and as life has become out of control recently I&#39;m struggling with finding a coping strategy that works for me. But I&#39;m not giving up, I&#39;m going to lose that 10 lbs and hit my goal weight of 140.
It was great seeing your mom.
I just started, im one day behind. I must say that your commentary and your attitude made me soooo happy. I wasnt having a bad day, not good either. I’m just happy I am doing this with you. I have been wanting to get out of this cycle of just eating and eating and eating and you really brighten up my day. It’s been hard to do some exercises since I have a really bad back (sciatica nerve damage) but i truly love this idea of doing this challenge with you!!!! I love my cuuuuurves and good luck to everyone doing this challenge! I’m 280lbs, if I can do it and have fun, you can too!!!! 💓💓💓❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈
NH is an absolute NO. She went establishment clearly however it matters not. Please America, please do not ever elect an female president. I think it’s been proven over the last couple decades that women do not have what it takes. Sorry ladies. Any woman as a U.S. president would have a huge target on her back. Not from American citizens, from other countries. Most foreign leaders would never ever respect her. We need male strength, and a whole lot of it.<br>DT will not back down unless there is a strong worthy candidate on the ballot. In my opinion, he doesn’t want to keep this up unless he has to. <br>Trump should never see a day in prison however, the desperation is heating up. People really have gone to prison committing what could be called a crime with no victims. If nothing else, the establishment will simply make it happen. They want him gone and they will succeed. They really are that evil. Again, proven over the last few decades.<br>Maybe we the people should save ourselves.
Who&#39;s toasting their poptarts every time they eat them??? That shit takes TIME!
I love your videos. I had NO idea you lost so much weight. You’re stunning!
This is making me want to eat ramen right now and I don&#39;t have any :( 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I’m sorry but on some level I have to believe that these people are actually stupid like the access to information Nowadays is ridiculous you know what you’re doing you’re just lying to yourself and you’re dumb for getting on a TV show and doing that. I just don’t understand that. How can you on one hand say I don’t eat sweets or anything like that I don’t have sugar but then on the other hand slamming large cokes, chocolate bars, and everything else with your fast food meals
If Ben had responded to the threat with &quot;That&#39;s not very ladylike behavior&quot;, things probably would have gotten violent from there.
I&#39;m tryin&#39; to hold my breath<br>Let it stay this way<br>Can&#39;t let this moment end<br>You set off a dream in me<br>Gettin&#39; louder now<br>Can you hear it echoing?<br>Take my hand<br>Will you share this with me?<br>&#39;Cause darling without you<br><br>All the shine of a thousand spotlights<br>All the stars we steal from the night sky<br>Will never be enough<br>Never be enough<br>Towers of gold are still too little<br>These hands could hold the world but it&#39;ll<br>Never be enough<br>Never be enough<br><br>For me<br>Never, never<br>Never, never<br>Never, for me<br>For me<br>Never enough<br>Never enough<br>Never enough<br>For me<br>For me<br>For me<br><br>All the shine of a thousand spotlights<br>All the stars we steal from the night sky<br>Will never be enough<br>Never be enough<br>Towers of gold are still too little<br>These hands could hold the world but it&#39;ll<br>Never be enough<br>Never be enough<br><br>For me<br>Never, never<br>Never, never<br>Never, for me<br>For me<br>Never enough<br>Never, never<br>Never enough<br>Never, never<br>Never enough<br>For me<br>For me<br>For me<br><br>For me
My controlled eating stems from my dissatisfaction with my body, but assuming that&#39;s everyone&#39;s justification is ridiculous. Controlling how much you eat is beneficial (unless you eat too much or too little)!
man commits murder: <b>life sentence or death</b><br>woman commits murder: <b>20 years out in 10 for parole</b><br><br>family court: man will give almost everything he has to the woman, she gets the kids, 50% of his income as alimony + another 30% for child support he can go live in a card board box, or go to prison if he don&#39;t pay.  also no he cannot see the kids unless the woman says he can.<br><br>woman makes false accusation against a man: everyone &quot;beat him to death or throw him in prison for life&quot;   he proves innocence: oh he scared her into recanting he totally still guilty black list him and make him a pariah.<br><br>man gets abused by woman, man gets arrested and banned from the home he pays for even if she does not live there and was just visiting.<br><br>ya men are for oppressed these days we literally cannot win no matter what we do anymore.
Preach sista Gabrielle!!! Another great interview Ashley.
Dang, regular men were eating bodybuilder off season bulking amounts of food 😅
They can be positive about their body, but they&#39;ll still die young from the many diseases they have from just being fat.
Great video Tati, thank you. However can&#39;t find the drugstore makeup in the description.
Would love to see what drug abuse deaths add to the drop in life expectancy.
Get off your pedestal, white people eat processed foods too, don&#39;t ever underestimate the power of big food, all of America is getting fat
I love his love for plus women! I pray for a designer dress from him one day. Dreams!
The alert fairies italy shiver because badge paradoxically bang plus a thoughtless dorothy. penitent, jumbled gosling
Betas need not breed
We do need each other. All people are born from women. Women raise and preserve our children (or should) women take what men create and turn it beautiful. They turn houses into homes.
Locking the doors and checking the back seat as a white girl thing 😂
It ISN&#39;T THE FAST FOOD, it&#39;s the people that eat too much of it. I haven&#39;t eaten fast food in about 20 years but I still like the thought of it but I know it won&#39;t be good for me so I just don&#39;t eat it. You can eat anything you want to eat, the key is THE QUANTITY and HOW OFTEN YOU EAT IT. These people have NO limits and eat all day long.
She is an Amazing person very crazy that she lost so much weight .
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he ends up marrying a woman with all these features...😂
Help lol I have not tried anything I was 21 walked into MAC and they colored matched my foundation I felt like a princess lol MAC studio sculpt spf foundation NC30 I think, but I feels heavy on me like if I need to put on a whole face of makeup then I use it. Also they pared it with medium plus mineralize I was 21 then and I’m 35 sad I need help I want something that makes me feel fresh easy on the coverage
im glad ur not fat anymore cuz u have like the 10/10 face, literally
Oh my goodness, Kiana! I’ve never seen a picture of you from your overweight days. I’ve been watching your channel for a good 7/8 months now and am very familiar with your story but wow! You looked so adorable😊 So young too🥹 Anyway, all the best! Xx
Sexy fat breast
I would like to know why my sister is still hella fat and she’s on ozempic prescribed from her doctor lol
I think that it is super just heartening that a size 6 or a size 10 or even a size 14 is considered big I can understand when obesity is into effect but liking to eat mac &amp; cheese once in a while and not having to watch every single thing that is in your body is in powering and Most women are at least a size 6 if not larger only Hollywood makes it normal to be a size 2.
I&#39;m watching many scooter Braun videos because I want to get famous, like ariana and justin, btw I think scooter is a great, nice and hard working manager
Everybody needs to get backyard chickens. Mine love to eat ticks :)
Truly though, body weight or fat is really not proportional to what people eat, or even how much they &quot;exercise&quot;. And deprivation always leads to metabolism deregulation and lots of problems anyway. If you line 10 people up and try to guess which ones eat what you&#39;ll find it is only out of luck that you can guess anyone.
Love this type of content!! I’m loving the Mac eyeshadow palette as well!! I’ll always be a wedge girl!! Great video!
Don&#39;t eat sushi. People who do are riddled with parasites.
idgaf what you&#39;re eating  EATING LESS MAKES YOU LOSE WEIGHT. These uneducated fucks dont understand basic calorie deficit
I have a strained relationship with my father and I often wish he was gone. I have so much anxiety knowing he is here and that I can&#39;t bring myself to speak to him. His life has been sad and pathetic(his own doing) and it would be mercy for it to be over. He causes everyone so much pain and says he will not apologize for anything he&#39;s done. I feel like I cant move on or heal while he is alive. He wants me and my siblings to just forget everything thats been said and done. It really pains me that he is alone, but he did it to himself.
Why did James eat it
Sorry but making someone associate an addiction or substance with something gross or unpleasant IS a real type of treatment that has been used for decades and for many it is effective.
Yes but primarily the lone star tick because of the meat allergy
it can be usefull  that the hole brush  set is light weight   and its looks flexable .
Hmmmm. Ronald Reagan destroyed over 40 years of economic growth and tax strategy. Eisenhower had a great <a href="http://strategy.tax/">strategy.TAX</a> HIGH to businesses and to defer those rates they paid the worker more and their benefits and a pension for retirement. so they were in a lower tax &quot;group&quot; Giving your employees more money and benefits. Lowered the burden. Now businesses take advantage of slave labor. The world laughs at America 😂 America is in the 2nd Gilded age of development smfh
Tati, I’m so glad to see your face on YT again. I was hesitant to watch bc my wallet is gonna take the hit. 🤣🤣🤣as always great recommendations and I’m glad your back!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m living for that sweater
I&#39;ve been struggling this past week because I just got a sleeve gastrectomy last Wednesday. I&#39;m having trouble emotionally adjusting to the change and wishing I had the ability to eat to cope like I used to. I&#39;ve been watching Megan Anne&#39;s and your videos since one of Megan&#39;s randomly got suggested to me. I was scared of watching it at first, believing it was going to be making fun of obesity or making light of the struggle. You and Megan have handled this issue with such care and grace that it was easy to subscribe to both of you. I realized pretty quickly I had been in Megan&#39;s similar position with the fat acceptance movement creating a loop of self-sabotage disguised as self-care. A year ago, I was close to 600 pounds. As of yesterday, I&#39;m at the 480-something mark and I&#39;m just getting started. Megan said something in her 315-pound life video that really hit home with me. She said she would have to talk to her therapist about how she treated her body so badly for all those years. I realized I need to explore this topic too. I treated my body badly because emotionally, I didn&#39;t feel worth being treated any better. Now that I love who I am on the inside and am incredibly grateful to my body for not giving up on me, I&#39;m using yours and Megan&#39;s videos to reaffirm I&#39;m making the right choices (and the truly courageous ones) in facing my fears, addictions, and insecurities to have a better quality of life. I deserve it. If you&#39;re reading this, you deserve to be here. &lt;3
You did amazing in guessing everyone sizes! 👏😆
Tess Holliday is THE LAST PERSON TO TELL ANYONE about eating properly!!! Is she srsly trying to make ppl give her credit as some1 who knows what is and is not healthy?????😳😳😳
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcSmq18VcDU&amp;t=11m27s">11:27</a> My wife and I go to see my mother-in-law every other weekend... <br>The breakfast consists of bacon, egg, sausage, bread and (sweetened) apple juice... and then on top of that there&#39;s a pile of food for lunch and dinner AND of course sweets and pie. It was not unusual for me to gain 5 to 6 pounds in ONE weekend on that diet. Now I am VERY careful about limiting my portion sizes on these weekend visits and it has helped control my weight.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
Can I try to recreate this look ? And tag you ? Please
She eats only salad..with 9 pounds of dressing.
Very great video its was can opener cuz much people dosenst se before 200 years ago =) Thank you Kiana from smart Canada =)
Eating fresh Vegetables Is good for you
Great interview. Dapper Dan is such an intriguing, talented, and learned guy. So happy for his success.
That look is so bad, it&#39;s MY worst makeup day. Seriously, Tati - What were you thinking? Orangey, goopy mess along the jawline, Great Wall of China shine (you can see it from outer space!)...Ok, enough! If I watch more, I&#39;ll be influenced the wrong way! Love you anyway, see you next time! 😅
This video was foreshadowing to Kylie&#39;s dollar tree vegan leather brushes.
I got Johnny beat, humbly😵
The Eyeshadow one with the tissue is actually one that I&#39;ve done before 👍<br>Great hack 👍<br>And James approved apparently 👍
The stories of the rape gangs in English cities is unreal, I won’t and don’t need to name and shame the groups involved but it’s absolutely disgusting!
I have Eczema on my eyes and face sometimes when I do my makeup it’s looks so dry that sometimes I can’t even wear makeup without it looking so dry and gross
20% pregnancy related death huh?<br><br>There is a death 100% of the time for abortions.
I&#39;ve fibromyalgia, during lockdown I started doing workouts, planks easy stuff 15mins then ended up doing like 4 15min workouts everyday for 2 years I slimmed down quite a bit was like 13stone to 10, my muscles went all lumpy my arms my abdomen all hard lumps never went away all this time, I&#39;ve tried so many meds now on pregablin works so well thank god finally I was wanting to die now I&#39;ve hope no panic attacks maybe that&#39;s cause I did mushrooms and saw there is no heaven or hell I was obsessed with hell we are all God or source code not sure yet but I don&#39;t get panic attacks or fear death anymore and that&#39;s a huge deal I was obsessed with thatbfor so long, anyways my muscles are still lumpy, it&#39;s definitely fascia related
I absolutely FEEL the multiple alarms thing 😅 in my case it&#39;s an ADHD thing, I struggle really hard with getting up in the morning and I&#39;ve also come to realize, that I&#39;m more of a &quot;nightowl&quot;. I think a lot of us are but our lives/jobs do not allow this. I feel way more creative and motivated at night, when everything and everyone is silent and I don&#39;t have as many distractions and expectations to fullfill.<br>Sometimes a &quot;bad habit&quot; is who we are but society doesn&#39;t accept this way of living.<br>Nevertheless, I hope you&#39;re successful in breaking this cycle for yourself. 😊❤
I let my children have fast food once a week as a treat and they were never allowed soda milk or water or nothing at all.
fat fuck: being fat is hard :( i can&#39;t move, i have diabetes, i can&#39;t walk T_T its so haaaaaard....*cries*<br>also the fat fuck: THE 60 BOXES OF PIZZAS IS NOT ENOUGH I NEED MORE FOOD!
Redcoats.... &quot;Don&#39;t do that on a first  date&quot; well to me that sounds like a great first date tbh 🤷‍♂️
The rotten stinger customarily hum because ping habitually vanish across a greedy george. dead, difficult volcano
Essence really does have a great selection!!! I especially love their lip glosses!!❤
What<br>Seriously promoting the beyond anorexic Eugenie<br>You must be proud<br>All that matters is money<br>Heaps weird karma
&quot;Trying being my size Amy&quot;<br><br>She was tho
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
Im a bit overweight and so i stopped eating all but maybe 300 to 500 calories a day and worked out 4 to 5x a week and could not lose 1 single pound. It wasnt till i started eating properly that i started losing weight.
Finneas, (Billie&#39;s brother), is actually a great guy with beautiful, amazing music. I appreciate that his Halloween costume here was less disgusting than most of these other weirdos.
Nathan looks great just like jeffree said but he always does the mask didnt do anything .<br> I miss them on youtube but im glad jeffree is happy and nathan to..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4FCoMsLr_s&amp;t=12m05s">12:05</a> To say it&#39;s not at all about willpower, but rather strategy or something else, isn&#39;t true. You&#39;re normally rational, but as is commonly the case, when people get blinded by commercialism (e.g. selling a product, in this case your program) their objectivity and respect for the truth become compromised. Plus their wording becomes less precise and filled with absolutes.<br><br>People can easily control the elephant. For example, stop eating, m@sturbating (nofap) etc. using willpower alone. For example, I was addicted to sugar, especially soda, but started having reactive hypoglycemia. it was manageable and I wasn&#39;t yet diabetic, but I gave it up without issue for years. I even store it cold in my fridge for my family and never drink it despite it being visible, cool and easily accessible.<br><br>I&#39;m not bragging. I&#39;m simply pointing out that almost everyone is capable of immediately and permanently ending a lifelong addiction cold turkey using willpower alone, even if the stakes aren&#39;t all that high (e.g. annoying, but manageable, episodes of reactive hypoglycemia). Not reaching for junk food, having binges and so on can easily be done by anyone. By no stretch of the imagination is this comparable to trying to fight a far stronger animal like an elephant. That&#39;s a gross exaggeration and a perfect example of defeatism, the blame game etc.
Really great information in this video.  I&#39;ve watched one of my more mature ladies review the Peter Rothchild&#39;s primer on youtube and  she loved it but used it with a powder foundation.  I&#39;m just never ever gonna wait 7 minutes for something to dry down to apply make up.  I do wait a bit between my skincare and I do that well before my make up routine.  Very interested in trying the RMS....I found that your images did show the differences, especially between the Beauty Blender and RMS where you had the foundation breakdown with the BB on the forehead.  Loved this video!!!!
I lost 40 pounds in two weeks. it&#39;s simple cut your food intake down. I ate two meals a day, meat, salads and exercise.
I have tattoos for people I love. One for my late grandfather, one for my late grandmother, one for my dog who passed away. Oh and one that I actually do regret getting a little 😂 but I plan on covering it up or removing it eventually. And I will be getting two more small tattoos, one for each of my sons.
I love Ashley’s personality.  She doesn’t feel a need to tone down her high energy &amp; I think that makes people around her feel more comfortable.  She’s very affirming and is a great interviewer too.  I’m not famous by any stretch of the imagination but I’d love to be her friend &amp; this seems like a fun podcast!
I used to not eat any veggies, ya know why? because when i tried them, THEIR WAY OF COOKING WAS ALWAYS DISGUSTING when istarted cooking my own vegetables o actually liked how htey tasted cuz it was to my taste pallet,<br>and by the looks of the food she ate, ofcourse she wouldnt-
Fatphobia is reaching us slowly because it&#39;s easily winded.
Gross 😝
I must have a low response, some days i forget to eat and only notice when i get dizzy :I
Im not fat cause i eat unhealthy all the time. Im fat because i will literally EAT EVERYTHING, in High quantities sometimes. It’s hard to calorie control cause im so busy I’ll forget to count what i ate &amp; I’ve tried it a MILLION times, to calorie count or measure food, and i just cant or I’ll forget after a week of doing it, or some shit happens in my life where I lose focus I really  DONT understand portions either. I see images of healthy food in large portions, then I replicate that (using minimal oil- Yes, thats something i do control) and eat it. But still turn out fat at the end because I’ve probably consumed too much ‘healthy’ food. My portion size idea is so distorted and im trying to learn the calories of things and use nutrition references on packaged stuff. It’s hard tho.
Never eat sugar, huh?  Yeah, and I&#39;m 500 lbs., a vegetarian eating plain salads with no dressing, and danced the lead in Swan Lake!    //s
With someone that obese a doctor supervised fast, ala Angus Barbieri, seems to be a viable option. And since they can’t get their own food it would be fairly simple to implement.
ok now hold on.  To lose weight you have to weigh portions and count your calories!  But Marie counting out her almonds is a red flag?  She&#39;s &quot;resisting&quot; because she doesn&#39;t want to eat a sandwich that has an obscene amount of cheese on it?<br><br>She needs help, for sure, but...
This show hit me with the reality stone. It made me realise just how much I was lying to myself, thinking I &#39;didn&#39;t eat enough&#39;. I was eating WAY too much! I started properly calorie counting and I lost 50lbs!
Only the President of the U.S. has a term limit and these old featherless turkeys don&#39;t. This needs to change! Gobble! Gobble!
Ashley looks like she has lost a lot of weight
Painted looks more for theatre , then normal makeup looks
I have loved you before but I often thought that you don&#39;t look all that happy. I don&#39;t know I felt like all the makeup and people and PR and the amount of work, you were desperately trying to fill up a hole and you cared so much about what others thought, even people who absolutely weren&#39;t worth it.<br><br>Now when I watch you I sense that you&#39;re having fun and that makes watching your videos much more chill and I&#39;m so glad to see you grow and live your life for you and for others but still share it with us.<br><br>Somehow when you share the real you with us, it feels so much more precious than when you were putting up a show. It was great, too, but one could really see the built up stress right under the surface.
God forbid children are gonna have fun when they are trying to lose weight
I&#39;ve heard folks say that misgendering someone is &quot;violent speech&quot;, which makes no sense. Here Zoey Tur is ACTUALLY threatening physical violence on someone for what he believes is misgendering.
Due to a digestive disorder I no longer eat fast food, like McDonalds, KFC etc. I actually hate the smell of it. 😊
You are so freaking beautiful realy you are one of most pretty people I&#39;ve ever seen and your videos are well made  it shows how much work you put into your videos. I&#39;m so happy for you bescause of your weightloss jorney you learned so much to get to your goal and I love how inteligent you are and how you constantly want to learn new things, I hope you will not have to struggle with ed nad weight no more and you find healthy middle ground and that you will get to any goal you choose  &lt;3
After eating sugary breakfast for so long I get sick if I eat it in the morning. So while in college I started to make myself different homemade burritos or wraps depending on if I wanted (or had time) to have a warm breakfast. <br><br>It does take time to meal prep which was something I thankfully had but I can see how even my homemade “grab and go” breakfast isn’t an option for everyone. Time is a currency after all.
Yeah my whole life my dad was abusive physically and mentally... but I still... i loved him he was my daddy but at 13 my dad cheated and left and I don&#39;t speak to him and since then I&#39;ve longed for a relationship and luckily rn I have enough self respect to wait for the right guy but I am terrified for the day that I turn to someone who is like my dad and I&#39;m hoping it will never happen but I never learned how to shoot and despite him being a police officer I never knew what it was like to be around a man who would teach me who I should look for😢❤
You are absolutely so real and awesome. Thank you for everything your love for make up your life for your animals your love for the great outdoors. You are entirely my favorite Shirley Katherine in  Phoenix.
Great podcast Ashley!<br>You’re looking amazing 😉 <br>Thank you for making my day ❤️🙏🏼
Anastasia Soare, the creator of ABH, is a Putin admirer, who started the war in Ukraine,  so this brand really needs to cancelled from the beauty world...
After the scenes with the fat girls you look superb in my eveys
For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
Please make a video about secret eating n how to overcome… what steps u took ect … I think am secret eating
I blocked Tik Tok and Instagram from my daughter&#39;s phone.  She survived.  Her friends didn&#39;t sacrifice her to the Peer Presure gods and eat her ceremonially.  She&#39;s fine.  So it&#39;s really a parent problem.  Parents unwilling to do whatever it takes to win that battle.  Up to and including canceling the phone plan for that phone and returning it to the store.  Whatever....it....takes.
They&#39;re all zeroes and men need to start treating them like it. Mean, nasty, unloyal, dirtier living spaces than any bachelor pad I&#39;ve ever seen, spread legs for triple digits, mentally ill, demanding, insane standards, want your money and things, I could go on.<br>The fact that there are millions of simps here and elsewhere giving these b__s your money is beyond me. Stop. Stop giving them anything. No attention, and definitely no money. Stop flooding dms with 💌💌💌😍😍, you look desperate and sad. You&#39;re validating the woman and in the process making a complete fool of yourself. <br>If you want love, save up a few K, go to the islands. You can find hookers or love, whatever floats your boat.
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
Sixty years ago when i was a kid we had sugary cereals, candy, cookies etc.  Yet in my household we had nutritious meals and healthy snacks such as fruit, raw vegetables and dried fruit.  My parents never brought that stuff into the house.  Carbonated beverages were a rare treat, purchased at the Woolworth lunch counter after buying school supplies.  Also unlike school kids today who are mostly bussed to school we walked or rode bikes to school.  At school we had two recesses and gym class a few times a week.  I protested when recesses and gym class were eliminated as cost saving measures as children need to move.  My class growing up had very few chubby kids.  Now obesity and even diabetes are plaguing our kids guaranteeing shorter and sicker lives for our children.  Its time to take control again and saying no to junk food and yes to physically active lives.
The only tattoo I&#39;ll ever get is the tattoo my father got of a traditional Lithuanian crusader to represent our Lithuanian heritage
its ok to fall off the wagon sometimes, it actually can get you to new heights when you eventually get back on track. she should use her friend&#39;s recent success as motivation, especially cuz they are still kind of on the same weight level...
People will do anything to prevent having kids, except refrain from having sex, which is the direct and sole purpose of having sex is procreation.
Loving the workouts! Your so great and positive! 😊
thank you for being such a great role model for us bigger size ladies
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
Great Stuff
Food left alone is just food even if you bring it. But when you eat it turns to fat. No
Hi! I used to watch your channel all the time, but I sort of fell out of watching makeup content. Recently, I&#39;ve been falling in love with your channel all over again! It&#39;s so upbeat, and I can take a second and just think about how fun makeup is! Thanks for all you do, and I hope you never stop posting!
Those breakfast sandwiches sound disgusting
The only foods I can nowadays binge on are homemade foods. <br><br>Homemade fresh bread with raw butter, raw milk, raw cheese, organic meats ❤❤❤ that goes hard
Elaine Welteroth is such a great model of a human!!
i feel sorry for all the pain and drama they are constantly creating for themselves. that attitude is really not working very well for them. it will be a miracle , not impossible, for them to think self-reflectivelyt in this lifetime.  too bad they can&#39;t harness that passion and conviction in a way that works for them.
I treat people with mental illness diagnoses including substance abuse and eating disorders. These “experts” ought to be barred from treating anyone. <br><br>There are MANY therapies that might have worked for her — much better than the stuff they tried. It’s really too bad that she didn’t seek help from competent clinicians.
Now people get shamed for being skinny.everyone is expected to look like a kardashian these days.
1. That was a really annoying video. <br>2. I agree with her, that shouldn&#39;t be considered &quot;fatphobic&quot;.<br>3. Its okay to workout and eat healthier but don&#39;t be like my older sister who eats like an ant and still does exercise every day.
The original comic book captain marvel  was a man.<br>Frankly,<br>if creators think that super hero fans actually want female superheros,<br>then damnit,<br>the least they can do is create something original instead  repackaging an old one with a makeover...
Lol this guy is an actual doctor? OMG. My husband and I are doing carnivore to lose weight. It is alot easier than counting calories and it seems if we eat any carb, mainly fruit we want more sugar. So this diet seems to stop the cravings for sugar.
lol Dr. CLITS? lol <br>I love him. And I think Carnivore is a great elimation diet...there are days where i&#39;m strict carnivore but most days I&#39;m eating whole foods/low carb.
when you lie to people and aren&#39;t honest. You are only cheating yourself
Eveytime I start putting weight back on I watch secret eaters and all of a sudden Im awear of what I ate 💀
Bro he&#39;s asking if he looks good like was there even a question<br>  <br><br><br><br>He can pull anything off<br><br>From a dress to,sweats and oversized sweaters
Great
Ok i didn&#39;t know of Ashley before this but she&#39;s pretty great.
Love all of your new videos! Most influencers don’t do makeup unless they are selling something! Keep up the great work!❤🎉
&quot;about 25 pills a day&quot; I&#39;m on 3 meds + voluntary supplements and think that&#39;s a lot...but I&#39;m also 20 and a healthy weight. I do have a lot of issues with food, especially sugar addiction and binge eating, and if I hadn&#39;t lost about 60 lbs due to anorexia during the pandemic I&#39;d be obese rn. I&#39;m trying to improve, and I&#39;m making baby steps, but it&#39;s so hard... I never give up tho, that&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever done.<br>my pills are for my mental health (depression and adhd), so at least having to take them isn&#39;t a guilty thing, unlike food is for me 😅
Awesome, Dollar Store brushes that I can use for my painting canvas, instead of my face. <br><br>The most of that $380 price is on that cheap pleather chrome fabric she used for the packaging, it&#39;s kind of cheap when buying that fabric- until you get into the packaging and sewing all of that together, then it&#39;s the labor to sew it together. There was PLENTY of cheaper fabrics she could have used for that type of packaging- for instance- 100% cotton plain color, but then that would have required some kind of plastic inserts to keep the cotton solid (like the bill of a hat/cap). <br><br>I&#39;m disappointed - where was the eyeliner brush, the eyebrow brush, and yeah, the lip brush!? Love the fan brush, I use that to paint grasses on my canvas - do a little bit of Bob Ross. Like, I don&#39;t just buy brushes for my face, but if I needed a Dollar Store brush set, I might consider this one. Somebody does it cheaper Kylie- seriously, I don&#39;t think her team is being honest with her. <br><br>But you know, this was 5 years ago.. keep shopping around, each their own.
Wonderful Video James Charles And Crew!  Everything James Charles And His Crew Create Turns Into Gold!  Who sings the song Between 24 secs and 27 secs into the video?
Children are conditioned into eating certain foods,  there will be some foods a child dislikes but in general, if you give them a balanced diet, they will eat what they are told to.  Fast food is a treat , not a diet.  My children were sent to bed without pudding if they didn’t eat their dinner.  I didn’t fry food, it was either baked, boiled or steamed, for their drink during the meal, it was either apple juice, orange juice or milk otherwise or they could have squash or water.  Trust me when I say, a child will not allow itself to starve if presented with healthy tasty food.  <br>Giving your child fast food as a staple diet, is a cop out by the parent.  You get out what you put in,
Ben Shapiro is actually correct Moreover it&#39;s common sense. Canada is a good example of this. America is not far Behind. But People can believe what they want to believe. Freedom isn&#39;t free. It generally cost. Good luck America Because it&#39;s gonna need it.
Kamala could bore  covid to death!
I can agree with every your point about this but I still think that that beat down argument about being able to make abortion after being pregnant after rape is okay. Yes, you still technically get rid of baby but this is unjust: why would someone need to sacrifice all her life and change every thing in her lifestyle because of some scum?
&quot;she&#39;s like an alien&quot; &quot;she&#39;s masking her true self and showing what she thinks people want to see&quot; &quot;she&#39;s like an AI simulating human behaviour&quot; &quot;she just wants attention&quot; &quot;she&#39;s not behaving like normal people would&quot; &quot;her expressions seem off&quot; Yeah everything about how people describes her just screams female autism + bpd to me. Just the way everyone reacts to her and all the things people pick up on. Someone in the comments even says she illicits, &quot;uncanny valley&quot;. <br> A good therapist having private sessions with each of them and then together sessions passing notes to a judge who orders a restraining order, psychological treatment, and whatever else becomes obvious as needed from the therapist would maybe have been best.
Fat Camp is amazing
Watching this stuff just gave me a stomach ache. People are showing how ignorant and ridiculous they are. What has happened to this countries intelligence?! Just creating pure confusion.
Who needs a movie theater when you have a 75 inch flat screen 4K HDR TV and a very expensive doby atmos surround soundbar? I mean, I&#39;ll never go to another movie theater again till the day I die so long as I have that. There&#39;s literally no point for movie theaters anymore, especially when you&#39;re spending fifty dollars on popcorn and a drink... I mean get the fuck outta here with that bs. Movie theaters wouldn&#39;t be dying if they&#39;d just lower their ridiculous prices on fucking popcorn. They&#39;re all smoking crack over there, though, so whatever. Popcorn is good, but it&#39;s not $50 good.
Scott Barnes is gifted Master Artist 🎨 and  also  Master Creative Make up Artist!  He is a Genius!
I think Tammy is being encouraged by the show&#39;s producers to gain weight and fight with her siblings. This is what makes good ratings and keeps the money flowing. Tammy probably figures that making tons of money is worth the risk to her health. She&#39;s going to play this for all its worth for the next couple of years, however long this drama will keep the ratings high, then she&#39;ll get serious about the weight loss.
I&#39;d love to see how these people are able to sit down in these outfits, and how they must &quot;bleed over&quot; and crowd out the people in the seats next to them!
I have severe endometriosis and myofascial pain syndrome. If I don’t move, everything fuses. I can’t breathe or sleep without pain and spasms in my rib cage and pelvis. I’ve started doing yoga before bed to get blood flowing. Helping so far…..
I was able to lose 60 lbs since August and I feel so much better. I ate so horribly and so much. I fed myself on fast food, sugary drinks, and candy, so much candy. I got up to 250lbs.<br><br>My doctor put me on a Ketogenic diet (with lots of cruciferous vegetables and salads), while I also did intermittent fasting and I was able to lose all of that weight. I was able to get off of the heartburn medicine that I was on and I just feel overall so much healthier. Plus being able to fit into thinner clothes was an added benefit as well.<br><br>I did get quite alot of help by using Factor the meal delivery service to order the correct kind of food, but it is way healthier than fast food and is about the same if maybe cheaper than what I was spending on fast food.<br><br>My relationship with sugar and food in general has changed so much. I am no longer being dictated by food and I have so much more time than waiting in lines for fast food.<br><br>I would like to transition to cooking from scratch all of the food that I want to eat, but my current work and living situation makes that difficult, but in the future I am going to work on that as well.<br><br>I also need to build more muscle and lose more fat.
As someone who has been on the side of super restricted food intake (one meal a day barley a portion size sometimes not eating at all) if I had to sit down and watch someone eat how I used to eat it would break me.
😭 i eat 400 kcals a day but binge up to a kilo of cabbage every day at 5 am 😭😭 cant stop helpp
I love that sweater💕💕
That&#39;s all she know how to do is talk about her.Disgusting
Can you eat a man, and grow a voice?
There is no real reason to go back to either church or synagogue. One judges and lies, the other is an outdate rule book of survival tips for a long ago era. Christian faith is well meaning, most of it and most of them, however, they believe several false premises based on a book written thousands of years ago for a different culture in at least three different languages. 
<br>
<br>It&#39;s been translated badly from the originals and the intent and meaning inadvertently and advertently, meaningfully and indirectly changed by culture, language, and not so well meaning heads of the church and well meaning but un-knowning translators. 
<br>
<br>It was written by men and there are many contradictions. Used to believe in the christian ideas but it&#39;s clear it&#39;s not God that they usually profess about and confound others with. If something doesn&#39;t make sense with itself, if something seems like it is NOT God, it&#39;s NOT God. 
<br>
<br>God made Adam with Even inside him and in his image, therefore God has both male and female aspects. In addition, the Bible doesn&#39;t tell all---God had to make other Adams and Eves after the first otherwise we&#39;re a race born from incest and we’re still incestors or incesting. Shhh. We’re not. 
<br>
<br>In addition, there were whole books of the Bible that some Pope decreed as not part of the Bible and took away. In those books, among other things, was the belief of reincarnation. Most Christians before that (and some after that) believed in reincarnation. 
<br>
<br>Not eating meat on Fridays was because…the fishing industry needed a boost. That had nothing to do with God. 
<br>
<br>There are also those in the Christian/Catholic faith that are NOT well meaning. Well, I guess. Was it well meaning to try to force Christianity on natives who believed otherwise? I guess it was to save their souls, which was meaningless. Was it Christianity to cause wars against the Mid Easterners who held the “Holy Land” (Christians lost that war BTW)?  Was it Christianity to allow the Children’s Crusades, which led to hundreds of children and teenagers being sold into slavery and those that weren’t died? 
<br>
<br>Some time ago, the Pope felt bad about all the artefacts that the Catholics stole from the Jews after KILLING them (your weapons are what now?) and decided to open up the vaults of the Vatican. He declared that he wanted to give back HALF of what was stolen by murder. How nice of him? 
<br>
<br>God is not a human being. He does not punish, he does not kill, he does not hate, he does not seek revenge, he does not make anyone suffer, he does not allow anything near a hell to exist or a demonic devil of evil to exist. God loves and his actions follow suit in that. He/she is not like us when we are out of the spirit and let’s face it, most of us are out of the spirit in our actions most of the time. The Bible is wrong on many counts and accounts. Yet at times it is correct. It cannot be the last word on God and spirituality. It was made by well meaning people (Most of them) to keep order in a confusing, murderous world of people gone wild. And it worked…until it was then used to create more strife, more rivals groups, and more division. 
<br>
<br>There are only two categories of people: those in the spirit and acting as such and the other category of those who are NOT in the spirit and acting as such. 
<br>
<br>Kirk Cameron and his end of the world movies are science fiction supernatural wrongness in their filthy “I’m right and you’re wrong and will die for it and suffer in hell for eternity” nonsense. Truth is: THEY are wrong and that will NEVER happen that way at all and certainly we are nowhere near an event or events like that. Or Damien the OMEN. 
<br>
<br>Anyway, NO ONE has to fear death. Betty White has a good perspective BUT even if someone didn&#39;t live a full life like she did or made more mistakes than she did, NO ONE has to fear death. 
<br>
<br>
<br>I know it&#39;s a very human thing to do but experts say that being born into this world is a more traumatic event than death and leaving this world. I know you said that no one knows for sure what happens to us when we die but that&#39;s not accurate. Many do know. For me, personally, it&#39;s beyond faith now. I have so much evidence of an after life and of a God (by the way God has male/female aspects of him/herself---I don&#39;t fully believe in the Bible as a last word but think about this: God took EVE OUT OF ADAM so Adam was he/she, too before that and if God made US in his image, then He/She is like that, too). 
<br>
<br>Even people who have made the wrong choices and been &quot;bad&quot; have a chance at redemption, and yes even Hitler. God loves and forgives EVERYONE (she/he does not play favorites). It&#39;s hard for us as humans who are not God to understand that. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Now, if there are a small percentage of human beings who are the dark ones (and only by their choice), they have turned their backs on God BUT here and there they have a chance to change their minds (a few that are both dark/light humans DO but most dark ones do not) and if they do not, even they will be brought somehow into God&#39;s light (of this I&#39;m a bit unsure as to how). 
<br>
<br>A loving God would not do some of the things written down about him. These things were written for another time and another place and another culture to keep law and order which in the far past, most did not have, in fact at one point very few individuals had and chaos almost ruled so well meaning men and some women wrote down laws and rules to follow to keep man and woman kind from exterminating themselves. 
<br>
<br>Some of these may have come from God (of which ones I&#39;m unsure). I am sure about this: God would not allow a devil like we think of as the devil (there IS an angel in charge of the Dark Ones to make sure they do NOT do much damage). 
<br>
<br>God would not allow eternal damnation and suffering so I&#39;m sorry horror fans there is NO hell. None. There are no demons. Only beliefs can make your own spirit create your own hell and your own demons. NO ONE is going to a fire pit for eternity to suffer forever: God, a loving God (and she/he is) would never allow that or let that exist. 
<br>
<br>GOD LOVES. NO ONE has to fear death of any kind because death is just a transition. No one is lost, no one is gone, no one vanishes forever. I think even people who don&#39;t believe in God and an afterlife deep down know this somewhere inside them. And these things are not just my opinion, my belief, my whatever. These things I have written here ARE FACT. 
<br>
<br>Of course with free will, your beliefs may vary but I&#39;m sorry about that but even that&#39;s okay, you are still, against all human media and human nature, SAFE FOREVER. No one has to worry or fear death ever. And even if you do, when it happens and you transition to the other side, you&#39;ll be as perfect as you were when you were created. 
<br>
<br>Chances are you&#39;ve been through a life and death before (some have been through it a lot----the church once believed in reincarnation until some pope in Venice decided that he wanted to take holy parts of the &quot;holy&quot; Bible out and censored it. 
<br>
<br>Don&#39;t rely on a billion year old book or books to know what your spirit inside, some of us deep inside, already knows: God is a loving God, God does not judge or punish or allow evil, God does not go against anyone&#39;s free will, and God has provided for an afterlife that is nothing like us sitting on clouds doing nothing but sleeping, resting, and playing harps. 
<br>
<br>Heaven is nothing like we think: it is the most excellent energy, the most wonderful of multiverses and you will have lots to do (that you WANT and LOVE to do) and the energy to do it.
Instead of traditional pasta dishes I make grilled chicken bits with spicy seasoning, and a mix of veggies with some corn, and then a fraction of a serving of pearled couscous and mix it together. The pasta (couscous) makes up a very small amount of the overall food, and paired with the small amount of corn, it is very filling. The other veggies (broccoli, carrots, peppers etc) and the chicken make up most of the dish. I use a little canola oil and occasionally a tablespoon of butter total in an amount that has 2-3 servings. Not a perfect dish for health but quite healthy especially compared with a large plate of spaghetti or whatever you may be indulging in too frequently. High in protein, low in refined carbs (comparatively with other pasta dishes) and fairly high amount of fiber depending on how many veggies you use. But it may not satiate your hunger as much if you are pounding refined carbs and junk food throughout the day. If you are being pretty healthy throughout the day, this is a great meal.
America may not the most obese, but they are the most unnecessarily obese
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”<br>5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️<br>6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death.
All the crayon eyeliners are so thick, I don&#39;t like bold ones. Are there any thinner ones?
I have tattoos for people I love. One for my late grandfather, one for my late grandmother, one for my dog who passed away. Oh and one that I actually do regret getting a little 😂 but I plan on covering it up or removing it eventually. And I will be getting two more small tattoos, one for each of my sons.
The best part of socialism Vs capitalism is slaves Vs willing slaves. If a normal slave from socialism is beaten I feel horrible, if a capitalist slave asks to be beaten for profit it turns me on. Big difference. That&#39;s why I&#39;m a capitalist, we don&#39;t have to force our whores directly, we can force them second hand, and that makes it okay. You people are so fucking stupid lol.
Dawn trained her body to lower its basal metabolic rate to match her reduced caloric intake and then when the weekend came her body go crazy to absorb and set aside as much as her food intake and as reserve (a.k.a. Fat). 😅 counterintuitive if you asked me;)
Ticks are not invasive species as a whole. There are some species of ticks that are invasive, such as the Asian longhorned ticks that have been introduced to North America but there are also many species of tick native to North America. And ticks ARE an important part of their ecosystems, just like sharks. They are a major part of the foodwebs and they also help control populations of animals by infecting them. Ticks are also an easy to study proxy for overall ecosystem health and scientists frequently use tick populations to determine overall ecosystem health. I would bet the person that privated her channel did so after being called out for what sounds like a completely BS story. If tick eggs hatch in your home you would have an infestation of larval ticks, which are the size of a grain of sand. The average person looking at an infestation of larval ticks wouldn&#39;t know what they were. Also, the cow killed by the &quot;super ticks,&quot; which are the Asian longhorned ticks, was not an adult cow and it didn&#39;t die of exsanguination, it died of anemia. All five of the cows mentioned in the article that died from tick infestation belonged to the same farmer who clearly was not practicing proper pest control and his herd may not have been very healthy to start with.<br><br>All that said, ticks are very unpleasant creatures and it is important to avoid getting them on yourself, your family, and your pets when possible. An important note on that subject, tick repellents don&#39;t necessarily repel ticks they just hide you from the tick so it will ignore you. Even if you&#39;re wearing repellent and treating your pets, it is still necessary to do a tick check after any time outdoors.
I&#39;m happy that I have a high degree of self-control when it comes to things like the amount of food I eat. It&#39;s more the composition that I have trouble controlling.
Im a binge eater; someone once told me it was fine because you body will not be able to assimilate the food if you eat it fast enough, so you wont take in all the calories... it didnt help me with my binges 😓
I don&#39;t want to be the idiot who&#39;s calling God queer. If this is an example of their reason and logic I maintain that yes, they have serious mental health issues and should be treated as such.
Interesting - as a T1D since 1972, aspartame was pretty much forced on me if I wanted diet soda like Tab at the time.  As I got older, I heard rumors and various discussions about aspartame that it causes cancer only in super high doses and some may have allergic-like reactions.  Those same rumors were around with Saccharin too which was also one of the only options available for those like me.  Today, NutraSweet is a stevia and erythritol blend using &quot;rebaudioside m&quot;, a component of Stevia that is supposedly sweeter and less bitter.  Personally, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the flavor of Stevia and erythritol gets tricky with the weird cooling sensation in some recipes and amounts.  I can say aspartame, being one of the few sweeteners I was able to take advantage of so long ago (and is still in some diet sodas), I&#39;ve never knowingly had any issues or concerns with blood sugar impact being my primary concern.  Today, while I do still drink lots of zero-sugar stuff like Pepsi, 7Up, etc I prefer to use Allulose in almost everything I cook if the dish needs to be sweet.  Really great job with the research, details, and walkthrough.  Thank you for putting this out there!
Shame is great motivator and work fine for lot of people. To be nice not always helps sometimes you have to feel discomfort from outside to wake up your true self.
You&#39;re so funny. I&#39;ve always thought a long bob would look great on you. I hope you&#39;re feeling better. 💜
This video was foreshadowing to Kylie&#39;s dollar tree vegan leather brushes.
Judging by today&#39;s society I&#39;d be surprised if fat camp isn&#39;t changed to something like &quot;fitness camp&quot; or &quot;gym camp&quot; or something less insulting
You can tell Jeffree is a pure person with how he treats all animals around him✨
Tati! You’re my absolute favorite go to for accuracy in your descriptions and recommendations, thank you! I live in the Caribbean and have been having problems following seasonal trends (fall and winter looks that hold up in the heat and humidity) I know you had some great tips whenever you’re on a trip but could you go through your goodie closets for us snowbirds? ❤❤❤❤
The purple ended up looking great!
Bought this palette after your recommendation and I love it!  I use it often and feel guilty about abandoning some of my other great palettes but it is such a fun palette with the different looks achievable.  Thanx for another great review.  And yes I also wish the zebra package was different but I’ll live with it considering the inside is awesome 😎

21 Senators are between the ages of 70 and 80 with 50% of the Senate being over 65. 46% of the Senate Democrats are in this age range along with 54% of the Senate Republicans. 32% of the House is 65+ with 40% of the House Democrats and 23% of House Republicans. <br><br>These are scary statistics when the median age of the American citizen is only 38.8 years old. This is a problem on both sides. <br><br>Every person of power in government, especially those in the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court should be required to have a yearly physical including a mental health screening, including a yearly mental fitness/competency test if they&#39;re over the age of 65. These results must all be made public. These also should be required before a potential candidate can enter or announce their run for office, no matter the age, but especially in instances where the candidate has had some sort of illness or injury that could affect mental capacity, such as, you know, a stroke.<br><br>Laundry list of requirements we should have, I know. But our Founding Fathers didn&#39;t have to deal with these things. People didn&#39;t live long enough to experience mental deterioration in the same way that we do today.
You’ll call her out on her delusions about fat acceptance, but are perfectly fine with playing into her “they/them” BS? 🤔
I lost a friend cause she was jealous I was getting married and lost weight so I was the same size as her and she couldn&#39;t take it. Breaking point for her was the guy she liked tried to hit on me, I rejected him cause I was engaged (and girl code) but she was so angry at me. And I totally know she was just envious of my life
I find it interesting that being skinny for women is viewed as awesome, but for men you&#39;re not seen as manly(this isn&#39;t to even bring up the health of the person; being skinny isn&#39;t necessarily healthy). Basically the same issue but different outcomes. An actual positivity movement could really tackle both sides but it seems the movement only wants to focus on women. It&#39;s kind of sad b/c that&#39;s just a further reinforcement of the gender stereotypes that are damaging us.
There&#39;s always someone more beautiful, richer, happier, more loved and more succesful than you.  The thing is: everyone are the main characters of their own stories, and a supporting character, an antagonist, an extra, or whatever in other people&#39;s stories - and pain us unavoidable. <br>Fun fact: a girl&#39;s self-esteem normaly is linked to her relationship with her father, even if she turns out to be a lesbian, and not much with her actual attractiveness (yes, you can have an extremely attractive tik tok woman that will fall for an abusive partner because deep down she hates herself and didn&#39;t learn what is love and respect). <br>Yes, people will treat you differently if you&#39;re pretty, but if your self-esteem is good enough, it won&#39;t matter how strangers treat you in normal daily life situations.
She is not an atheist! <br>she just said that God is good and he does good things and good things aren&#39;t happening to her right now.<br>An atheist doesn&#39;t believe God is good or bad just that God does not <a href="http://exists.it/">exists.it</a> just sounds like you are peddling doubt for satan just because good things are happening to you he must not exist. That&#39;s definitely not a measure of his existence. You don&#39;t worship him he does not know you. The one that you do worship is out of default. When you deny the father based on your lack of blessings as a measure of his existence that is kind of an oxymoron or just a moron
Your videos are so helpful to me on my weight loss journey. They help me to stay focused on my goals❤
Okay... but on the other hand... there pretty girls and sparkly dresses still have freedom of speech. There are still people and still care about human issues.. so like I agree with using caution when listening, and being strong minded enough to take in informations calmly and develop your own opinion.. I don&#39;t think we should be telling them not to speak on something cuz their stupid.. we don&#39;t know her whole story and any personal reason she feels compelled to speak... ja feel? Or no?
When I had weight loss surgery one of the things I did was  I went on roller coasters too because I couldn&#39;t previously, so I can totally relate to Chris.
And still the super skinny one&#39;s look better than the big one&#39;s :/
i’m 12, and 188 lbs (last time I was weighed) and i’m 5’4. i’m gonna start trying to lose weight by learning different types of dances like jumpstyle (I think it looks super fun and I love the music the people dance to) i’m also gonna try to eat less. I’ve honestly have been trying to lose weight for a while but I would lose then gain but i’m trying! :3
I’m obese but I would never blame anyone but myself for what I did to myself.
It looks like he identifies as trans fat.
Like some other people below say, the mental health aspect is so important. I was having a rough patch last 2 years with toxic relationships, eventual suicidal ideations even, losing hope in life. Going out from that hole made things so much easier. Feeling loved and accepted for who I was, even with the weight I put on because of binge eating, having more activities to do.. It all helped so much. I still find myself skipping meals, sometimes accidentally, sometimes because I&#39;m sometimes afraid to start eating for the day- I know I have more way to go. Still feeling guilty over eating &quot;too much&quot;, for having a piece of chocolate, worrying if I trigger myself into a binge. Just ate a praline, drank a cup of tea and hey, I&#39;m not binging :) Idk it&#39;s just so good not to be that bloated self.
I don’t understand how McDonald’s is more convenient. It takes way more time to go get McDonald’s then fry an egg. It takes maybe 5 minutes to cook eggs. My normal breakfast of 1 egg, chopped spinach, chopped tomato, cut up turkey pepperoni scrambled together and wrapped in a spinach tortilla with hot sauce takes me maybe 7 minutes to prepare and cook. And it’s healthy and filling and balanced. I get it’s not everyone’s cup of tea but I mean how is driving to a store and sitting in a drive through and then feeling gross by the time you get to work more convenient
For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
It’s not the companies’ fault! It’s the kid(s) and the parent’s fault. Companies can’t force you to eat their product. You as a parent choose what your kid can and can’t eat. Banning cartoons off fast food and junk food is BS. That’s marketing… nothing wrong with that. But it’s you, the parent(s) who makes the decision if you will buy said product for your kid. But, when the parent(s) gives said option to the kid, it’s now up to the child to make the best decision. Now, said child will most likely choose as their parents would, thus meaning if the parents set good examples, the child would most likely pick out healthier options… and then splurge every now and then. You may be asking how do I know? Cause this is how I am being raised. I’m 16 and a half now, in high school, and I make plenty of my own decisions. Almost all of which were influenced by my parents. I know I have insane metabolism, but I admit, I do eat junk food. It’s just I’m constantly burning those extra calories. On an average day, I need as much as 2500 calories. On weeks when I’m up at the fire college with my explorer post doing training for up to 10 hours, I easily eat 3000-3500 calories and plenty of water and electrolytes. I know my body type, how active I am, and how fast process proteins, carbohydrates/sugars, fats, and other nutrients. That’s being said, my parents guided me throughout life to make a good, solid choice when it comes to a meal. This is why I stand by the claim, “ The parents and children are the problem… not the companies.” Change my mind….
I hope you would make video on intermittent fasting in the future and it&#39;s benefits in loosing weight
YESSSS YOU BOUGHT YUCCA!!!!!! Lemme get my popcorn. Cannot keep my fat little fingers out of those metallics its so much LOVEEEEEEE for me!!!
If I were her sister, I&#39;d lock her in a room and give her a strict as all hell diet until she loses weight. Once she&#39;s able to walk on her own, I&#39;d leave. That&#39;s it. She&#39;s an adult. She can take care of herself after that. I would literally be so done with her so quickly
Mike Jeffries was ugly A/F yet he graded employees by their looks
Every interview that was featured wasn’t really about the person being interviewed. She framed everything in a certain way so that the conversation ALWAYS went back to her. Gross.
Ok but it’s ment for already applied makeup not thick swatches
One of my biggest concerns would be triggering even more unhealthy behaviors in the “super skinny” participants because they are so disgusted by the food they’ve had to eat for a week.
Kiana, this is the first video of yours I saw and I&#39;ve been marathoning your stuff since. You motivated me to buckle up and make healthier choices for myself. I don&#39;t weigh that much, but I&#39;ve not been happy with the weight gain I&#39;ve been having. My brother and I agreed to do this together. He&#39;s got a longer journey ahead, but we&#39;re going to be each other&#39;s cheerleaders and ensure we lose weight, keep it off, and stay fit! Thank you. In just a day you opened my eyes to face reality that we need to make changes NOW.
You explained the concept of intuitive eating quite precisely ;). And although you might speak quite critically about HAES in one of your videos, you just pointed out some of the main principles around HAES food advice :). Eat when you&#39;re hungry. Stop when you&#39;re full. Include feel-good movement. Eat fibre. Enjoy your meal with all senses.  What a certain Instagram culture made of this inclusive movement and its good intention ... well, I share your criticism at some point. By the way these principles equal the principles of Intuitive Eating (such facts combined with audios for subconscious changes). 1. Eat when you&#39;re hungry. 2. Eat what makes you feel happy and healthy. 3. Enjoy your meal and trust your hunger signals. 4. Stop when you feel adequalely satiated. Started both HAES theory and Intuitive Eating practice to get back in line with my body and to make peace with it. Most ironically, lost weight with it. Now I&#39;m combining both aspects and write about HAES and body-related topics in my blog,, among other topics  :). Another fun fact at this point ... In earlier times, social pressure and negative feelings led to emotional eating (my Intuitive Eating programme steps into the subconscious part of emotional eating) and since I have been practising this idea (theoretically it was known to me through HAES), the same negative emotions result in  total lack of appetite so I must force myself to eat then. Sorry long post - but might be helpful for you :).
Size dosent matter but age does
a free nation is the most terroristic nation cause its a mutiny of illetrates..............other than saying a &quot;free&quot; nation..............better say an &quot;educated nation&quot;.........nothing more and nothing less....................educative prospect is totalitariately different from work or any other religious prospect &quot;(generally)&quot;...............it makes u to know ur place........no matter what.................phylosophy and science is an edcative prospect................when ever i have heard the polititians wrath exercising and therefore wrath polarizing the public in that direction..............in itself is the 2nd biggest form of terrorism.........precisely after indoctrination precisely religion..........then freedom(it lies on the second rank)
Strangely enough we&#39;re told in the UK we were at our healthiest during WW2, due to food rationing. No obesity, and the poor were guaranteed meat in their diet on a regular basis.<br>Yet at the same time the meals people invented during rationing are the bloody disgusting meals people associate with Britain today, long after they&#39;ve gone out of regular usage.
I&#39;m know this is a 3 year old video, but boy does it ever hit me hard. I&#39;m trying to keep to 1200 calories per day, and feel so guilty when I don&#39;t, and relieved when I do. I check all labels for calories and sugar and it just consumes my life to lose weight. I&#39;m an emotional eater too.
Has anyone problems with setting spray making their hair gross ?
And then you realize it was their father&#39;s batter that went into that cake.
The milk was better than one size the milk one didn’t much like at all
&quot;That&#39;s kinda what we are designed for.&quot; Excuse me? What exactly is it you want to imply here. This woman is working at home on her podcast promoting women&#39;s safety talking about the for left and how women&#39;s rights are being taken away. Are you forgetting that back before electricity was invented everything was made by hand. The women were working they just did it by pretty much making everything the family needed that the husband would never do in his entire life. Plus nurses female nurses that were the closest things to female doctors also existed. It is something that has always existed. Mid wife&#39;s don&#39;t forget hand maids female slaves. Seamstresses and female politicians in royalty. Not to mention elders and nuns any other kind of work that women were able to get. It all depended mostly on their education and class pretty much. You can&#39;t afford education if you have to pay for it and you are poor. No one stops to think about that do they? Be grateful for you got today ladies. If you do not then history is doomed to repeat.
I loved it. and if you think the movie was about making fun of a fat man, you clearly missed the point. You probably never have wathed a Darren Aaronovsky film before. The move wasnt about a fat guy, but his redemption. Its a redemption story.
The only people mad at that line are actual skinny bitches. Women like that don&#39;t like us real curvy girls go talk about it so fuck it !
I&#39;m a fat, middle-aged, upper middle-class, conservative, happily married white woman. Who am I supposed to blame my obesity on? These people are nuts.
How can a father steel money from his son? And what&#39;s up with the mother? The parents are blaming others. Surprise... noot...
“It’s because they experienced something earlier in their life that distorted the way they meet their needs” ‼️‼️‼️ I don’t know if you’ve done a video particularly on this but what a wonderful way of putting it. Knowing our needs and meeting our needs is such an important subject for everyone, regardless of their health or weight or psychological status.
How does a man have sex with a porcupine? Very carefully. Just ask the father of whatever that thing is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLsr8wl7j2Q&amp;t=4m11s">4:11</a>.
I was about to comment that I&#39;ve never felt insecure about my appearance, even though I&#39;m not exactly a D-cup model with long flowing hair xD But then I remembered the first time I went to Paris and how me and my sister felt like absolute trolls. Sure, we&#39;re skinny, but being Dutch, we felt so tall and unelegant compared to all the petite girls with thick, dark hair and mysterious dark eyes there. Somehow, everyone we saw in Paris who was our age, was ridiculously attractive looking. So yeah, I don&#39;t get insecure easily, but when surrounded by people who are all more elegant than I am... I totally get the feeling.
My question is is your Merch in kid sizes
I think Google become fat activist.
Suger doesnt cause weight gain directly, fat does. Dairy like cheese, milk etc are superfoods designed to make babies gain weight. When you eat suger as well, you use the sugers 1st, then the other stuff like dairy get stored as fat. Too much suger while over weight means not all the suger is being used, and that causes type 2 diabetes. Reducing suger is a good idea, but stopping dairy is far more effective. Also, dont eat on a schedule, only eat when your actually hungry. Most people have no idea what actual hunger is though..
god, i used to be so miserable when i worked in hospitality. it was my WORST nightmare. i worked as a barista in a small family owned specialty coffee chain and they lived by &#39;the customer is always right&#39;. their big thing was to NEVER ask customers to leave, even after closing. in the summer, we had beautiful tables on a tall building&#39;s terrace overlooking the city and it was so nice at night. our business hours were 8AM-10PM but the strict company policy was to never ever kick guests out. they&#39;d let them sit outside until 11-12PM before very gently telling them we closed two hours ago, we would not get paid overtime, and on top of that, there was 30 more minutes of work to be done AFTER the last customers leave for closing. the place was located in an extremely boujee neighborhood and the people were very affluent and so incredibly entitled and abused the company policy to the fullest, only to leave a $1 tip for three people who stayed well into the night to accommodate them... it was the worst two years of my life working there. i was so unhappy. i hated our regulars from the bottom of my heart. DIRTY rich, zero manners, never tipped, talking about how they&#39;re cleaning their ex wives in divorces and sleeping with teenaged girls... there was one regular who had six sons by like 5 different wives, he would come in with them and his little ipad, order a single americano (no tip) and leave his six kids to terrorize the staff who had to keep them entertained (the youngest was maybe 18 months) and everyone had to suck it up because he was friends with the owners. when he was bored of his stupid offspring, he&#39;d bring them to us to babysit for free. never ordered a single drink/juice/food for the kids. i would literally walk up to a table without saying hello or smiling and just asking what can i get you. no hello, no goodbye, that job sucked the life out of me. i quit two years ago and i genuinely feel like i&#39;m still carrying that fatigue and stress in my bones.
He&#39;s just making fun of women,  doing his disgusting,  silly woman-face act. It&#39;s hard to believe people take him seriously.
They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re just lying to avoid accountability. Disgusting.
Ben Shapiro is disgusting!
Body shaming is FOUL and its especially disgusting when women are body shaming other women. Every single one of us has had a mean, unwelcome commitment about our bodies, before. EVERY ONE of us. The fact that they know how that feels and do it anyway, to anyone, makes me SICK.
I listen to podcast originally and was inspired to see if there was a video and here I am 😘. I just have to say I was touched by the transparency of Jada’s mom when she said “ what you really are is a judgmental bitch”. That statement was a key a opportunity for freedom.  I do not think I have ever witnessed this the ability to not have fear of judgment.  The bondage of judgement is a double edged sword it goes both ways.  Great shot thanks for the wow moment

For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
I don&#39;t imagine people like her to lose weight? I mean if they re so big and helpless but manage to have such a mean spirit and make everyone around you miserable how would they be when they lose weight ?
No matter Adeles size she&#39;s a beautiful strong woman. Tabloids are scum.
Wtf ben.This is how society percieves women including u.U make vids shaming overweight women and now act like it never happens.Grow tf up.
I’m sorry I don’t feel sorry at all for people who are addicted to fast food. I just don’t. In the end it’s still choice. If a piece of food could make someone that ill like we see the lady in black practically vomit as if it’s a dead body, but she can handle fast food so easily, Fuck her. People act like they have no choice. They still have a choice. They can put something different into their damn mouth but they don’t want to because they want the pleasure of their fast food so let America die in its unhealthy decisions. I’m sick of people making excuses about why Americans are so fat and unhealthy. You’re adults not children. Put the damn shit that’s healthy in your mouth and swallow it. Unless you have issues that literally prevent you from eating, then you can do it. You just don’t want to.
This is an excellent chat. I&#39;ve been watching this podcast for some time now, but none of the other episodes (no shade) have hit me like this one. I&#39;m going through my own path of forgiveness and I didn&#39;t have the true connection between forgiveness and freedom but now it&#39;s so apparent. I&#39;m excited to catapult myself into this forgiveness so I, too, can rid myself of the shackles of non-forgiveness.
I remember going to a music festival a few years ago in Rimini, near Bologna Italy. I loved the beaches but I know a lot of Italian&#39;s say the beaches there suck 🤣<br><br>There were no McDonald&#39;s or fast food places within several miles. Nearly EVERYONE was in great shape, it completely put me to shame. I saw like 2 overweight people (1 of them sadly being myself,) there over the 3-4 days I visited, I couldn&#39;t believe it. Everyone was either lean or near jacked. Then came back to my home city in the north of the UK and it was business as usual, about 50% of people obese.....
Americans prefer to eat one fast food per day?? Like breakfast or lunch or dinner or what? Why y&#39;all so lazy fat fucks?
Never knee how to describe it to someone how i still felt &quot;fat&quot; in my now healthy body but you said it the best in here! Thanks 😊
Why the hell are muckbangs so popular? watching people gorge themselves is disgusting.
Such hideous people......disgusting
Diet is gross.
I think Tess and Gwen should be forced to do a Supersize vs Super-skinny diet swap. Then at the end of the week, confront Tess and be like, &quot;But did you die???&quot; She&#39;ll probably be 40 lbs lighter too.
No more animal fats.
This is about the left, in the USA especially, tearing down the institutions and principles that this country had as the directing force to govern this nation.The left is anti God, anti constitution, anti individual freedom, anti family and anti American. The left are mostly from the democrat party  and are Marxist,socialist and communist , this is what they mean by progressive and liberal. As Hillary Clinton mused, &quot;The Maga Republicans need RETRAINING CAMPS&quot; to brainwash them to Marxism, or perhaps to exterminate them.(concentration camps?) John F Kennedy would be considered a &quot;MAGA REPUBLICAN&quot; today by the &quot;liberal left&quot;.
very good and informative video, Kiana! I&#39;m seeking advice in the following: I&#39;m 17 years old, have circled through various disordered eating patterns for the past 4 years (binging, purging and restricting cycles), tried intermittent fasting up to 50 hours, counted calories and tried every diet. i&#39;m at a healthy weight now and in recovery from restricting and started HRT (testosterone) maybe 6 months ago. Everything came crashing down on my body since then and I&#39;ve had some intense changes in my appetite and metabolism (that is expected on T HRT, but i&#39;m struggling to manage my eating habits). I try to not eat a lot more than I have before but my cortisol is at an all time high. I&#39;m very active (taking care of various animals and also endurance running) and I&#39;m so so scared of gaining weight. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with severe hypoglycemia(on the verge of vomiting) and have to eat even though i have had dinner (veggies, fiber, protein, slow carbs) maybe 4-5hrs prior. My sugar keeps crashing multiple times a day and Ive come close to collapsing from hypoglycemia multiple times even though I eat normally moderate portions 4 times a day(no fast food, lots of fruit and veg, oatmeal, whole grain, greek yogurt, lean meat, white rice). Is there anyone who has any advice or anything? I&#39;m desperate for anything.
Anorexics look in the mirror and think they`re fat, so possible she could have it. 😁😆🤣
Does the the Lawless gloss have a sting to it from the plumper? Anyone know?
I have put on lots of weight in the last few years. It’s because I eat like a pig. And eat all the bad foods.<br>No point in hiding the truth
Not eating is kinda automatic weight loss lol. It even saves you money!
Makes you fat. Makes you sick. They feed you drugs. The cycle of corporate greed! Food, Drugs, insurance. FDA is mafia.
Help lol I have not tried anything I was 21 walked into MAC and they colored matched my foundation I felt like a princess lol MAC studio sculpt spf foundation NC30 I think, but I feels heavy on me like if I need to put on a whole face of makeup then I use it. Also they pared it with medium plus mineralize I was 21 then and I’m 35 sad I need help I want something that makes me feel fresh easy on the coverage
As soon as you bring up &#39;fatphobia&#39; you&#39;ve  lost me. None of you subsequent arguments will be taken as valid. :)
K Brett I like your content and all, BUT glock s are ugly, I would prefer a 19-11 any day
I am down to 23% bodyfat 116.6kg from 25% bodyfat 123kg(thats 271lbs for americans) over the past few weeks.
I think that this product getting smaller and more expensive is actually helping me lose weight because I only buy stuff when it&#39;s worth my money (has a good unit price) 😅
If simple carbohydrates are not very good for a diet, does anyone know if fats like butter, milk, cheese are okay in moderation? Or would it be best to avoid them as well?
Thanks for watching! Check out my other videos:<br><b>This is Why I Stretch EVERY DAY</b> - <a href="https://youtu.be/01LbcCDTwF4">https://youtu.be/01LbcCDTwF4</a><br><b>Disgusting Ticks Are Ruining My Life</b> - <a href="https://youtu.be/4pWlRpW3ZR0">https://youtu.be/4pWlRpW3ZR0</a>
I actually love the LA Girl tinted foundation,  it&#39;s lightweight on my skin but covered me well.  Enjoyed this video.  And Juvias place eyeshadow is fanominal,  I have several pallets that I love.
The Ugly Narcissist embodiment, how dare she attacking a gentle soul like Johnny Depp? I was so satisfied she lost the case &amp; been exposed to the whole world
Plzzz do a full face of one sizeee!!
Obese people generally live off the government they don&#39;t contribute to society it&#39;s a drain on social security
as a former fat person, it doesnt seem at all that you don&#39;t hate fat people. Fat people hate fat people and you just make them come out of their cognitive dissonance.
This is so disgusting to watch they call Jesus non binary, Jesus is gay... In muslims we believe Jesus also called as Isaa alaihasalam is Allah&#39;s Prophet , we being a muslim never ever make fun of him and these people are derange ... This is Sad !!!
Loved the movie so much. But the Strange stuff, in the beginning, was off like Shapiro says. What gets me is that in Endgame, the Ancient One says that Dr. Strange was supposed to be &quot;the best of us&quot; referring to sorcerer supremes throughout history. At the beginning here, Strange who is supposed to be the adult acts like the stereotypical irresponsible reckless teenager misusing freedom, strength, responsibility, etc more than spiderman does. This is especially true when you consider Wong&#39;s warnings. That does fit his personality though. But it was a great movie. Top 5 Marvel movies for me.
They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re just lying to avoid accountability. Disgusting.
I&#39;m gonna be real with y&#39;all, losing weight is challenging. It took me 2 years to finally beat obesity, and most of the weight loss only started happening after a few months. There were many nights of feeling miserable for having a craving. I dreaded exercise but slowly learned to love activity in my own way. The worst part was looking in the mirror and wondering if anything I was doing was actually going to work. The progress was slow but necessary. It didn&#39;t help me feel less ashamed in clothes or that I couldn&#39;t eat certain foods. Oddly enough I made far more progress after learning to love myself unconditionally no matter what state my body was in. Learning to appreciate food from a holistic sense really helped. The clothes part can still be a challenge today, even when people say I look good. But that&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll work on that.
I know it&#39;s not super luxury but high end my ride or dies are makeup by Mario soft sculpt skin enhancer and makeup forever aqua resist eyeliner and mac fix plus. And my highest definitely luxury semi-beauty item is Bacarat Rouge perfume.
I did that a lot along my child and teenagehood, then I stoped for 4 years! Lost a lot of weight. <br><br>However, in the pandemics and with other life problems, this behavior came back. I gained 40kg. <br><br>Now it&#39;s been five months of living a healthy lifestyle. I&#39;ve lost 10kg however the will to binge eat is still very present, specially in harsh days....
Lol someone had to tell her. Well said, what she’s done is disgusting and if it wasn’t so messed up it would be almost comical.
I&#39;m glad I watched this video, as someone who&#39;s struggled with being the chubby kid all my life, when i looked through your channel I got extremely bad vibes. Because I am someone activeley working on myself. Eating better, exercising, everything. But when I saw your videos all I saw were clickbait titles and I got very uncomfortable. I wasn&#39;t even aware of this fat positive movement, I was only ever aware of the bigger body positive movement. Which I am very much in support of. And I&#39;m glad you clarified obese because a lot of people think overweight and obese are the same thing and they very much aren&#39;t.
i always said that if i ever won an academy award..i would show up in the clothing expected and then right before i went on stage to collect my award i would tear off my clothes revealing a potato sack..wipe off the makeup and take my hair down,,leave my shoes under the chair and walk up on stage and tell the audience to give it to someone who needs it more than i want it...lol... I would rather have nothing and be at peace with myself than have everything and be a miserable human being.... a cup of tea and a cool breeze on my face is worth more to me than anything hollywood could ever offer...thats a fact...
Hahaha little she knows that staying at home it is a job too. A 24/7 work plus work. Precious and fulfilling 🧡
Oh my. How sad. At first the arrogance assaults one, then one thinks of her coming fate if something in her heart doesn&#39;t change. Sad. I pray for her salvation, in the name of Yeshua Messiah.<br>Amen<br>PS.<br>I&#39;m not a &quot;religious&quot; person either.
Sorry but twelve years ain’t that long…. Give advice when you are 20 plus in…
She probably has an eating disorder, but definitely not anorexia. I&#39;d say she probably has a binge eating disorder, where she can&#39;t control how much she eats. Binge-eating disorder is a condition where people lose control of their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food. Unlike bulimia, periods of binge eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge eating disorders are often overweight or obese. I heard her say at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTJ4EfkalNQ&amp;t=3m35s">3:35</a> (roughly) that she won&#39;t eat all day and then binge at night, which is common in binge eating disorder and bulimia. So IMO, it&#39;s not anorexia, but probably another ED.
I wonder what they&#39;d think of me. I, medically, cannot gain weight. I wonder if I&#39;d give off major &#39;fatphobic&#39; vibes for something i can&#39;t control.
The fact that Ashley is thick and likes to workout is very attractive... I love me some Ashley 😍😍😍
freedom of speech grown up .
Yea it’s not that gross when women you don’t know have hairy pits, most men have hairy pits I mean if she was a attractive model yea it’d be weird but not something to trip over.
I&#39;m know this is a 3 year old video, but boy does it ever hit me hard. I&#39;m trying to keep to 1200 calories per day, and feel so guilty when I don&#39;t, and relieved when I do. I check all labels for calories and sugar and it just consumes my life to lose weight. I&#39;m an emotional eater too.
White chocolate is very temperamental it can’t get to hot or it gets thick and never! Add anything to it to soften it other than crisco
No James your not fugly
I tend to Boredom eating. Not much of a going out kinda person so it&#39;s get boring n when bored I tend to overeat. And when watching reels of eating food then hunger automatically comes. Which is like fake hunger not the actual one
Ok while the weight loss is great... why hasn&#39;t she done anything about not having teeth? She has so much success and more than enough money to fix them... so why leave your mouth mushy?
&#39;Is the chair fatphobic?&#39; is my current favourite quote ever haha
You’re one of my comfort YouTubers so I keep rewatching these videos over time. I didn’t realize it the first time watching, but now I can see that it’s so obvious that something similar was going on with my ex best friend and me. The way Tammy speaks reminds me so much of her suddenly and especially the way she speaks about Amy is kinda similar to how this „friend“ spoke about me. <br>In my case it wasn’t about weight loss but about psychological issues and how one handles their trauma. It always kinda felt like a competition, like who had the worst trauma, who was the bigger victim… she openly told me she was jealous of me many times and also how my trauma must not have been as bad as hers or else I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish the things I have. (Which, I don’t have an amazing life with tons of accomplishments. I struggle with depression and everyday is a fight for survival sometimes, but I’m not gonna give up on life and work really hard to maintain a somewhat hopeful mindset and I’m really grateful to still be here) she always blamed someone or something else for her failures, even when it was absolutely clear, that sometimes it was just the consequences of her behavior and she felt entitled to everything cause she had it so hard and everyone was out to get her, supposedly. It really hurt, seeing my friend so unhappy and I was trying everything to be supportive but I struggle with my own issues and have a limited capacity. When I told her this, she completely exploded and to this day is convinced that I am/was actively trying to sabotage her.<br>But somehow it makes sense now why she is that way. Im glad to have herbeizubringende my life but I don’t hate her and I really wish her all the best and hopefully one day she will be able to self reflect about her behavior and create a happier life for herself.
It&#39;s kinda sad because people set really low calorie goals and expect to not be hungry like 1200 calories for an overweight person is not realistic for weight loss
Just bought a chubby liner. Going to try it tomorrow.  I have oily skin.  The liners always bleed.  The only one that never does is the Maybelline ultra liquid waterproof eyeliner in black.  Love it.  Won&#39;t try no other. They all bleed.
Thank you kiana. I was struggling with attitude perserverence and positive thinkong my whole life. Watching your videos was an eye openner. I finally believe in my self and I will do my best to lose weight. Thank you so much!
Gross 😮
Our mantra was &quot;keep her off the pole&quot;. It was after a documentary showing the link between a lack of fatherly love and strippers. So if my partner was behaving in a less than ideal way...I&#39;d just quietly say &quot;keep her off the pole&quot;. He&#39;d know exactly what I meant and adjust immediately 😅 It must have worked, because she&#39;s now nearly 19, with a lovely boyfriend and is training to be a nurse. 🎉🎉🎉
It&#39;s so gross.  I cannot stand Ticks.  Yuck🤑
As a doctor I all I can say is my experience is that people often lack the education necessary to identify the reasons why they don’t succeed. They also are deeply sad or frustrated most of the time, which needs addressing first. Plus, when 40% of chronic obesity is due to undiagnosed ADHD, they need to be screened for this and treated if appropriate because they aren’t going to lose any weight of their brain drives them to eat all the time.
Of course it was...I dont see any heroin users positivity,just because like pronoting fat positivity, is not healty...AT ALL!
I have different problem, I east small amounts every hour. I can&#39;t eat like full plate of food and then I get hungry very fast. Only happens in UK, when I leaved in Europe I had no problems keeping my healthy weight even eating sweets everyday.
beautiful... two chubby white girls... MONEY... any chubby black girl... poverty/diabetes/disrespected...<br><br><br>good times...
I found that exercise doesn&#39;t help me lower my appetite at all. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite. I started going to the gym regularly about two months ago, I eat more that I did, healthier than I did, and god am I hungry all the time! Now I just consider it a way to allow myself more calories while not gaining weight
When you are lifting weights concentrate on pushing your bellybutton to your spine. Concentrate on your core. This will help with your neck issue.
it&#39;s the same thing for people who are underweight anorexic too. Many of them will say &quot;I&#39;m healthy&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s a lifestyle&quot;, or even &quot;I&#39;m not underweight&quot;-- or worse &quot;I&#39;m fat!&quot; They don&#39;t believe they&#39;re withering away. They believe they&#39;re the most obese person in the room. Eating disorders are all like that, based in self-deception and delusion. It&#39;s also just like a food addiction, only on the opposite end of the spectrum. Instead of lying to others that they&#39;re on a diet, anorexic nervosa patients will lie that they did eat, and they&#39;ll lie to you, me, their parents, their doctors, everyone. The real question is... how does one even talk to someone who is delusional (whether they&#39;re deluded into not believing their overweight or underweight)? How does one get them to see that they&#39;re severely underweight, that they need help, or that they can die at any moment because of it? I don&#39;t know the answer. All I know is that it&#39;s sad. For many addicts that recover, sometimes it&#39;s not even a matter of hitting &quot;rock bottom&quot;. They say that addicts will change when they want to change.  So how can we even begin to help anorexic or obese people see their unhealthiness? Delusions are just that-- no amount of data or proof will undo a delusion. The person themself will have to be the one to overcome it. I don&#39;t know one person on this planet that knows how to hurry up that &quot;overcome delusion&quot; process, though, in order to save lives.
I’m an obese 12 year old girl and it’s so difficult to live 😔 my obesity makes me feel depressed, unloved and (very very much) a financial burden to my mom
god damnit i am crying ugly tears at tammy&#39;s &quot;i sure the hell did!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m worth it!&quot; she was so sad and hurt and didn&#39;t value her life before i feel like an old friend conquered a terminal illness fr omfg. YES TAMMY
Jesus. dude. You are showing you&#39;re ultimate thicko right here. Mouthing off at an angle that doesn&#39;t apply to the subjects you comment on. TRY HARDER.
Obese people doesn’t understand they are exchanging their lives with food
Fatty protests too much me thinks
Just disgusting
Never knee how to describe it to someone how i still felt &quot;fat&quot; in my now healthy body but you said it the best in here! Thanks 😊
Disgusting. I lost my appetite entirely.
honestly never watched a video of that dude and seeing this now I only find it disturbing and gross...can&#39;t understand how people enjoy this kind of content.
😠 Fat camp should be for the parents not for Children, to learn how to feed their kids, support and encourage them emotionally and become more active and avoid pitfalls.
Can u do a commentary on someone who lost tons and tons of  weight and....gained it back?
Holy crap. I am a type 1 Diabetic and I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s actually endocrinology why I see my blood sugar tank when I&#39;m cooking a meal I&#39;m really anticipating and I&#39;m &quot;starving&quot; by the time I finally sit down. I&#39;ve learned to be careful not to overeat on accident. I&#39;m one of those people, I guess. I have a continuous glucose monitor and it&#39;s been wild watching the patterns over the last three years after drastically changing my lifestyle. Let&#39;s just say I took my a1C from a 10 to a 6.0. My other stat I&#39;m proud of is going from 260 lbs to 180, and still going. I&#39;m also frankly disappointed in my care team for never giving me half as much information as was contained in this video. I had to figure out that high glycemic index foods spike my blood sugar myself and do research on what foods wouldn&#39;t on my own. I got there eventually. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m healthier now at 35 than I was at 25 😉 Thanks for letting me toot my horn a little. Genuinely fantastic video!
&quot;I have no control over what he eats&quot; bs...you buy the food...you can lock the cupboards, you control the portion size, ...yeah, you can control what the kid eats!
Not only that how is taking care of yourself fatphobic . Now I could see if she started running around calling everyone fat but she didn&#39;t or hasn&#39;t. She only referenced her own health and body
Diet is gross.
ive started watching this show on youtube recently and had to stop. they had little segments in between that were painful to watch and put unhealthy thoughts into my head. they had segments focusing on anorexia and right after have segments of a perfectly healthy normal looking woman doing everything she can to get &#39;quick fix&#39; solutions to acheive the body shape she wanted. she&#39;d talk about her flabby tummy and &#39;rotund belly&#39; without even a morsel of pudge on her, going from workout place to workout place, even doing laser lipo treatments! so on one hand it&#39;s &#39;quick fix weightloss is bad&#39; and then on the other &#39;here&#39;s some quick fix weight loss tips!&#39;. i found myself kind of obsessing over the people with EDs and what they would do to lose weight, paying hyper attention to the superskinnies. putting that in my youtube algorithm is actually what made your videos start showing up n my feed, so in a way im grateful, but yeah, i can&#39;t watch that show anymore!
OK the video was probably wrong but don’t bring back bullying that’s horrible imagine going to school every day having multiple bullies bully you having the whole world bully you do you know how much suicides would come back if you want to bring back bling that’s disgusting
Someone who has used bad habits their whole life, shows they are ON TRACK to use those bad habits for the rest of their life.  Let&#39;s not get into the well super fat is ok, but oh not super, super fat!  Maybe if we stopped apologizing for the truth, more people would be happier, and alive!!!
Just saw the documentary. It was fascinating to see a part of my childhood deconstructed like that. Still, I&#39;m not sure I agree with the general idea that the backlash against the brand and the effects are &quot;good&quot;. <br>First of all, there wasn&#39;t really any karmic punishment here. There was no comeuppance. The man was making 40 million a year for a while and then quit working with a 27 million dollar retirement payout. He won. He&#39;s a winner. Second, while I definitely agree that certain aspects of the company needed to come under scrutiny and needed to be eliminated (the treatment of the models or the sexualization of teenagers, for instance), I don&#39;t think trying to force the brand to cater to everyone at the risk of being destroyed by public outcry was a good strategy. <br>Abercrombie was built on one idea of what the ideal All-American look/lifestyle is. People who disagreed with that idea, who found themselves excluded from it for their skin color, religion, or body shape could have come together to build a new brand that took the same idea and expressed it in a way that was inclusive, without trying to force the notion that the traditional, very conservative, very preppy, very white idea of Americana needs to die. Why? Why can&#39;t the people who still feel that way have businesses that cater to them? Why isn&#39;t there room for more than one idea of American identity? <br>If you don&#39;t feel like a business fits you, take your money elsewhere. Why do you have to actively try to destroy it so you can feel validated at all times in all places by all people? Like, I know Chick-fil-A doesn&#39;t like me. I know it doesn&#39;t want my business. I&#39;m not going to picket to try to force them to do it, I&#39;m just going to buy my chicken elsewhere. Will I let other people know about the things I disagree with about Chick-fil-A? Sure. But if they choose to still go there, I&#39;m not going to cry about it and start a protest.
Aww as a big girl, I LOVE this episode and I love the fact that Christian designs for big girls as well. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m dressing up because the way plus size clothes STILL are like a one-size-fits-all way. Designers assume all big girls have big boobs or big arms or huge legs that I look like I&#39;m swimming in a lot of the clothes I wear, and it&#39;s embarrassing! But Christian gets it. Love this episode so much ♥️
I am always saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson is NOT a scientinst, he is just a showman, america likes him much because he is speaking what they want to hear, nothing else.<br>But this debate proves that he is not smart enough to compete with Shapiro.<br>Also we segregate sport FOR A OBVIOUS reason, one of this reason is fairness in competition. That is why we have categories, so people on similiar level can compete against each other.<br>For example: Sex category, weight category, age category...<br><br>Anyways during whole dabate Neil deGrasse Tyson is avoiding precise discussion and and only jump from one topic to another.
Thank God it&#39;s gone. The fashion industry contributes to so much pollution and environmental hazard and waste, not too mention the exploitation. When big corporations fail, an angel gets its wings. Also, why do you hate fat people?
Fat Food
What does idiot and know that God is often referred to as father.  My father, who’s thout in heaven.<br>I am a father and the last time I checked I do have a penis. Therefore God has a penis.
your point about food apps absolutely resonates with me, even if I have no eating or weight issues. though I wfr and the temptation of ordering so easily, specially in the busy work week, is huge. I do order regularly but try my best to regulate and choose healthier options.<br>I live in a country where food apps are still an expensive delivery choice and fast-food isn&#39;t seen as standard food for lunch or dinner. we can order packed lunch in the apps, which helps me a lot to order health food for more than a day, but boy. it does take a conscious effort and I feel it.
Some fat titties! A compliment btw!
It’s because they’re allowed to “sample” whatever food they want at stores &amp; people are too scared to stop them for fear of losing their jobs &amp; they know they can not show up for work &amp; still be on the schedule. They’re given an easy path for promotions giving them access to higher pay which means more food. Pretty much the only time that they’re not overweight is when they’re only fed prison food, they’re a basketball or football player, or they’re on crack
Lose weight..easy, STOP EATING.So I am something of a health nut, have been since my teens, what is common knowledge to me is surprisingly not know by many.<br><br>And the scary thing is. when you get down to it, in most stores 90% of what is on the shelves is trash, I mean actual trash. it won&#39;t provide you with vitamins, nutrients fibers or proteins.<br><br>if you don&#39;t have an active lifestyle, and a slow metabolism. you basically have to eat high protein low sugar diets. I am a 6,2 muscular male, and because my job is sedentary I eat  aprox 1800 calories a day (supplemented by vitamins). and that is enough to maintain my 90kg weight, anything above 2300, and I start to gain slowly, but steadily.<br><br>You have to think, you have to exercise control, because anything non-fresh, is usually bad (bad meaning low nutrient density). you must read all the labels, stuff that seems fine like &quot;meatballs&quot; could have as little as 30% actual meat in it.<br><br>its actually crazy, you have a whole isle for different crisps, but only a small section for fresh foods.
Maybe its not that you hate fat people, but hate that fat people suffer for being fat. There&#39;s a lot of complicated emotional/brain stuff there.
Can u do a commentary on someone who lost tons and tons of  weight and....gained it back?
I felt bad for Daniel for a long time because his father stole his inheritance money, until I researched more about his grandfather. Allen’s father was actually the biggest gangster in Australia for decades, so that inheritance was obviously blood money.
Hm I don&#39;t agree with many points here. Because a &quot;controlled&quot; Binge eating IS having control. The most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when the blood sugar drops so much that it&#39;s a body&#39;s mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things. But the thing you said with school is a whole different topic. For a diet it&#39;s bad, but for keeping your weight it&#39;s good.<br><br>I did this most of my school time while having hashimoto (which means my metabolismn is so bad that I get weight fast and lose weight hard) but I had my rule , first of all I never in my life eating breakfast if I have to wake up early, I had rule that if I have 6 hours school I eat and drink nothing during that time, if I have longer like 8 or 9 hours I will eat one apple. And this I continued like 7 years (?) and - it was fine. In the evening I ate tons of trash , huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly. Because it was like remaining in control during the day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy, and in evening you reward yourself for it. And I never gained any kg of weight during all the years. Of course I didn&#39;t lose neither, but also not gained weight. <br><br>So I disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar.
Intentional Weight Loss Doesn&#39;t work? I&#39;m an even 6 in height. <br>At 18 I was a literal skeleton with skin and weighed 165lbs, at 30 I was 242lbs and quite fat. <br>Now at 32 I am 171lbs simply by cutting excess food and walking instead of taking the car or bus. <br>These people have no accountability and blame everything on society instead of introspecting.
If you&#39;re hungry that means your body is burning fat calories. That&#39;s your goal, to lose weight. Not to keep stuffing food in your fat face. You ain&#39;t never going to be nothing but a morbidly obese slob.
I&#39;d say I&#39;m liberally republican. I believe in the Republican values, but I also share some sentiments with true liberals (to clarify, non-radical). <br><br>We need a strong basis for the country, but there does need to be some change in the system about the little things to appease the people such as legalizing weed and giving back rights to certain freedoms we have been restrained from, such as the &quot;fighting words&quot; basis.
Although Tammy&#39;s mentality is obviously wrong, I think too many people are blaming her or seeing it as her fault. It&#39;s not her fault for having fears and doubts, especially when she&#39;s so dependent on food. I think she needed to have some kind of reassurance or therapy before she started the weight loss journey
For almost my entire life, I’ve struggled with eating disorders and being underweight. Starting when I was around five or six I weighed about 50 to 60 pounds  and stayed almost that exact weight, even losing about 5 to 10 pounds on and off until I was about 10 or 11. Even then, when I was well aware that I was underweight, I was still freaking out about being overweight and fat and needing to lose weight. I am now 13 and still struggle with that, but I am much better now.
I couldn&#39;t disagree more with the notion that you should feel good about your body when it is manifestly not attractive to consensus reality. This is just another form of delusion. I am HAPPY that I have a voice in my head that will say &quot;hey you&#39;ve put on 8 lb, better knock off the sudden fat intake!&quot; or &quot;great, now it&#39;ll take 4-5 days to fully get rid of that chick parm sandwich and 3 slices if pizza you ate when drunk because alcohol makes you do stupid things with food&quot; or &quot;get your ass to the gym now bubba!&quot;....That self-denigration is EARNED. Prancing around in a nikini when you&#39;re over 400 lb and telling yourself it&#39;s all normal is just more delusion.
OMG yes it was totally my dream to go to fat camp as a child as well! I wasn&#39;t even particularly fat, just demonstrably not the skinny child my parents wanted me to be.
“Today we’re gonna try something new and no I don’t mean your father”<br>I wheezed-
Where are the creations for short women and men? This is a big lie about his so-called size diversity. He is a short man, and when was the last time you saw him feature a short woman or man on the runway?
If you haven&#39;t eaten for 6 hours....you&#39;re not &quot;starving&quot;.  You&#39;re just plain old hungry.  That&#39;s it.  Starving is when your body fat percentage drops so low that your body begins to snack on your muscle and organ tissue.  It&#39;s pretty much a guarantee that anyone who is dieting will never be &quot;starving&quot; if they weigh more than the number of the Marine Corps Height/Weight chart. We need to stop using language like &quot;starving&quot;.  And people who are fat need to get comfortable with feeling hungry.  People need to have enough self discipline that they overpower their ghrelin.  They need to be able to say to it... &quot;Who&#39;s in charge here?  Me...or you?&quot;  And then take charge and do what needs to be done.  Abstain from eating until the chosen time.
I just wanna follow up on my previous comment (and again I realize I&#39;m talking about being TOO SKINNY but...I think this applies, because:)<br><br>My parents always tried to FORCE ME TO EAT, and then gave in when I refused, or sent me to bed as a kid, or would say they&#39;d take something away and I wanted bed that night anyway...<br><br>Things actually changed when they OFFERED me dinner and it was OPTIONAL. I could eat my frozen meal...Or if I like what they were cooking I could join them and...IT WAS TOTALLY MY CHOICE. Eventually, in this environment, this was when I decided it wouldn&#39;t hurt (In fact it would HELP) to join them once or twice a week since my dad always cooks fresh..OR AT LEAST HEALTHIER THAN WHAT I EAT... Options.<br><br>The Fat Kids need that. An OFFER. A CHANCE. Thankfully my parents DID eventually realize keeping me at the table wasn&#39;t the answer. They set &quot;deals&quot; for me as a child. And as an adult they always ask how much I will ACTUALLY eat (And I eat any leftovers the next day).<br><br>This seems nuts but I used to be able see my ribs (SLIGHTLY. I wasn&#39;t starving.) Now I have an actual belly that jiggles a little bit...)<br><br>But if only these kids parents WOULD OFFER THEIR KIDS AN OPTION. Or I guess In this case...LET THE KIDS OFFER THEM AN OPTION!<br><br>My dad is the cook in house BUT he DID GIVE US CHANCES and while me and my youngest brother blew ours, my middle brother actually DOES cook for our Dad, and even sometimes gets the honor of being his Sous Chef. To be fair though my dad DOES let ME make the green bean casserole for Thanksgiving (He always browns the Fries Onions a Little too much and for some reason THAT dish is one of two dishes I can TOTALLY NAIL..)
very good and informative video, Kiana! I&#39;m seeking advice in the following: I&#39;m 17 years old, have circled through various disordered eating patterns for the past 4 years (binging, purging and restricting cycles), tried intermittent fasting up to 50 hours, counted calories and tried every diet. i&#39;m at a healthy weight now and in recovery from restricting and started HRT (testosterone) maybe 6 months ago. Everything came crashing down on my body since then and I&#39;ve had some intense changes in my appetite and metabolism (that is expected on T HRT, but i&#39;m struggling to manage my eating habits). I try to not eat a lot more than I have before but my cortisol is at an all time high. I&#39;m very active (taking care of various animals and also endurance running) and I&#39;m so so scared of gaining weight. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with severe hypoglycemia(on the verge of vomiting) and have to eat even though i have had dinner (veggies, fiber, protein, slow carbs) maybe 4-5hrs prior. My sugar keeps crashing multiple times a day and Ive come close to collapsing from hypoglycemia multiple times even though I eat normally moderate portions 4 times a day(no fast food, lots of fruit and veg, oatmeal, whole grain, greek yogurt, lean meat, white rice). Is there anyone who has any advice or anything? I&#39;m desperate for anything.
Maybe we have a different recipe in my country, but Diet Coke is just disgusting and it’s not popular at all
If I were her sister, I&#39;d lock her in a room and give her a strict as all hell diet until she loses weight. Once she&#39;s able to walk on her own, I&#39;d leave. That&#39;s it. She&#39;s an adult. She can take care of herself after that. I would literally be so done with her so quickly
I wonder what they&#39;d think of me. I, medically, cannot gain weight. I wonder if I&#39;d give off major &#39;fatphobic&#39; vibes for something i can&#39;t control.
Children children...<br><br> Some people are gonna be fat. They like food and they like sitting. That is all. That has always been all there is to it.<br><br>Stop looking for a goddamn institutional problem that would be responsible for people enjoying the burgers a little too much ! <br><br>This boogeyman of racism is a huge distraction to the new generations. They don&#39;t even understand things that have always been.
I was born in Slovenia, it’s ex Yugoslavian country thats been independent since 1991,  and fully joined EU in 2003. <br>We were part of Socialist regime before and very fast adopted  western capitalism. <br>On paper everything was state owned before but in practice workers were the real owners of every factory, of every business. <br>Salary gap between a CEO of a company and a cleaner in the company were not as crazy as today.<br>One example is (and I’m talking this from my own experiences, from being a kid and teenager growing up in that regime)<br>My father was a electrician for a big curtain factory and my mother was a sales person in a grocery store. At the end of the year, when the business made more money then expected both of my parents received part of that money and every summer we went on a one month vacation in Croatia where accommodation was 100% payed by the company. These summer houses were owned by government/workers so they got to use them. <br>My childhood memories were beautiful with my parents not being overworked as they became after. These vacations were modest, no 5 starts hotels and so, its Croatian places that are now being rented for 200€ per night.<br>Something that now 90% of the Slovenian, Croatian families simply can never afford.<br><br>With Slovenia becoming independent and my parents being very motivated to create something of their own. They started their own business in 90s with the money that was quite easy to save during Socialistic times. They started with opening one “Car parts store” and eventually added 4 more over the years. We were financially doing very well, i guess you could say we were rich. My parents were extremely hard working and smart with money. They build their own house, out if the city and even bought 2 big apartments that would supposed to be for me and my brother. So looking from outside everything was great, but the quality of life went extremely downhill, my parents were overworked, those one month vacations were gone, simply because there was no time for that, if we could squeeze 6 days per year it was already a lot.<br>With parents being overworked, health problems occurred (thankfully we didn’t adopted western healthcare practices, even now going to doctor is practically for free)<br>My parents were stressed, working 6 days per week, my 7 years younger brother had the luxury of getting a lot of material things and opportunities that i hasn’t ( he started a lot of hobbies that he never followed trough) but he missed on having happy parents that had time for him, like for instance I had. Even though he had much more things I definitely consider myself as a lucky one. <br><br>Fast forward to today. Due to globalisation and foreign corporations majoring of Slovenian businesses went bankrupt or were simply bought up by businesses from richer countries. <br>Small country with less than 2 million of population on the border of Europe union simply cannot compete with richer, bigger, more established countries of EU.  <br><br>One of the biggest problems national problems based in my opinion is housing crisis. Prices are the same as for instance in Germany, where I live now for 6 years.<br>Except that the average salary is 800€ net while in Germany is 2300€ net. <br>Even with very poor calculation skills you can determine that anyone owning and paying of an apartment in their lifetime in Slovenia is practically impossible. <br><br>This is my explanation of Socialism based on the experiences I collected while growing up in a very interested era, the conversion from Socialism to what I call “the disease that will end humanity - mother and father of Evil - Capitalism”
I’m fatphobic about my own body but don’t give a shit about others. I’ve had chronic hip pain for 8 years. It’s only gotten better this year after I lost 23 kilo. I’m terrified of getting bigger again because I don’t wanna be in pain like that again
Gross 😝
They should make a show where an overweight person spends an entire week with a healthy weight person eating and exercising exactly what the healthy person does!  I suspect the overweight person will feel like they are being starved and cannot keep up with the exercise!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTLe9kBfO4c&amp;t=9m53s">9:53</a> The HYPOCRISY of saying that these shows degrade people and teach children that those who suffer from obesity are freaks and outcasts, only to say later on that Ableism in “comedy” performances are ‘funny and acceptable’ is truly disgusting; imagine how people that have Special Needs feel when they are ostracized and deemed ‘unwanted’ in any form of media.
I think they have interpreted the science a little wrong.<br>After a very hard &amp; intense glycolytic work out you are significantly more insulin sensitive. In this state the body is better prepared to handle a meal containing simple carbohydrates with high glycemic index, with out causing a spike in blood sugar and insulin as glucose is more easily directed into skeletal muscle.<br>So if you eat healthily all week a hard work out before a big Sunday lunch can help to<br>off set the carbohydrate load<br>It does not mean that you can  get away with devouring  3 pizzas and a few tubs of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s after a just a 25 minutes on the elliptical machine .
I feel like it&#39;s always the positive, bubbly and optimistic people who can laugh at themselves and are honest with themselves who are the ones succeeding in these massive weight loss journeys.
Wait! U look a lot like the make up person in the Disney plus show called proud family or smthing
Fattieboomba
if she went from regular to diet soda then she coukd lose lots of weight and still enjoy her soda
Thank you so much for your excellent content! I&#39;m trying to figure out how long the word weight loss journey has been used. It seems like I&#39;ve only heard of it recently. I much prefer the word that you used in the video story. to me a journey implies an ending. Yes, Once you get down to your goal weight, then I guess your weight loss journey has ended. But story seems to encompass that my healthy eating plan is something that needs to  continue for the rest of my life , and I&#39;ll have to continue to watch for regain.
Tammy is disgusting🤮🤢
When rosie talked about the weight after giving birth, that&#39;s my life now and I love that she said tht I&#39;m so thankful
I am fat, I was even more fat, but I started eating a little less, and I lost weight.<br>Objectivly speaking, eat less, lose weight. If you have mental problems and dont fix that, you&#39;ll eat it right back, but eat less lose weight
Honestly there are not so fat people in britain at all by a long shot. I never saw a really huge obese person in california but i saw really enormous people and i had never in my life seen such peopke in the uk. There are some obese peopke and some fat people for sure but i never saw anything like what i saw in california it was amazing and mind blowing ...i had to try not to stare but my eyes would just be drawn and my jaw would just drop completely because i had never seen anything like it. And i believe california isnt as bad as other usa
Animal fats dont make you fat, they make you healthy, its the greains and crap,. Also maybe you should have mentioned the gene they have that help them to put on fat at an amazing rate. This help pacific islanders make the most of good times for the lean times.
You lay down with another person of opposite sex, and engage in the exchange of bodily fluids...the result may very well be pregnancy. <br>  You willingly engaged in the act, unless forced, then I stand with you...if not<br>  There is no &quot;get out of parenthood free card&quot; for the mother, like there is none for the father
OMG !! What a disgusting 🤢 🤮freak
I bought the summer Friday mini lip butter balm set and I’m considering going to their website to get the full size trip because I love them so much. Then I also bought the Laura Mercier blush trio, which I think I like so far, along with the hourglass jellyfish palette I am in love with
Kiana! Video suggestion: how intuitive eating doesn&#39;t work for obese people because their satiety mechanism is and food intuition mechanisms are shot and the evidence is plain for everyone to see. That awful fat positivity song talking about listening to their bodies is a joke.
I‘m a Chinese, It&#39;s funny to see you guys in the west culture go through this madness era, If Mr Oppenheimer alive, He will be forced to make fireworks for the BLM LGBTQplus，your liberals are going too far left, 😀
&quot;This meat isn&#39;t sold i any other country!&quot;<br><br>Meat and fat doesn&#39;t cause obesity. Sugar and carbs does.<br><br>Carnivore diet is a panacea!
sO yOu tHiNk iM sKiNny got me laughing so hard😂😂
My family is full of bad marriages. My grandfather beat the shit out of my grandmother. Grandma was glad when he died but she had to raise 5 kids on her own. My father ,repeats the same behaviour as his father. Throughout my childhood and teenage years , my parents fought. My father would come home drunk and beat my mom. They are still married but not happy. Its more cordial now. My blood boils when he acts normal as if nothing happend earlier. When you present marriage to a person, i&#39;d rather stay away. I can barely talk to guy. I dont even makeup or dress pretty. My inner child is still struggling. I&#39;d rather die alone than be with a wife beater or a narcissist. How do you sell this idea of marriage to me?
i absolutely love how he includes plus size, i would love to have his clothes if i could afford them.
Bru the one size was an 11/10 when it literally smudged😂
I have super thick brows. I don’t do much (or anything) on the daily but for full glam, a bit of pencil and something to add hold, so about 5 minutes? Also I have a stupendous brow lady and she keeps be legit.
It’s not that she doesn’t want to give up overeating and smoking, it’s that she wants to keep her self harm. We assume that as a species we always want to live and thrive, but that’s not necessarily the case.
Google employees are really about to be losing all kinds of weight with the layoffs.
I always love your videos! L’Oreal also has some new skinny bullet lipsticks. I haven’t tried them yet but I’m so curious about how they perform.
Alot of people in the Pacific had diets that had the majority of their calories coming from tubers like taro or sweet potatoes.  Their diets were very low in fat.
fat people making fat jokes 👍<br>skinny/healthy people making fat jokes 👎
It kinda grosses me out Shane keeps mentioning he&#39;s sweaty... I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s trying to be funny but... 🤢
Shouldn’t the lip plumper go on first
Prayers for salvation of souls,  these people are selfishly entitled, the world must rotate around the self designated king, And get a pronoun wrong and &quot;off with your head&quot; So ,much hatred, and confusion .The simplest ,basic reality is God made man and woman, man and wife, for creation of family. Again now, you just define your own family.  The world is full of haters ,Satan, the Father of lies is prowling the earth to populate Hell .
Such hideous people......disgusting
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
Although the percentage of obese people in the uk is almost as high as in the USA, as a European from another country, not UK, it seems that there are fewer super morbidly obese people in the uk.  I used to live in the uk and plenty of people are big, but there is lower cut off.  They have far fewer Slatons!  So it&#39;s not for the sake of shade!  In other ways perception of Americans from ny or california is very thin!
For almost 14 years since 2009 when I was 28 I stayed stuck between 285 and sometimes only around as low as 275 at the lightest I was stuck no matter what I Tried I felt like there was no way to lose weight. I thought it was due to my thyroid issue but back then and for a long time moost of my life I grew up on junk food. I don&#39;t honestly think my parents would have put these foods in our bodies if they had known!<br><br>Last Sept I noticed something was gouing up my weight at my heaviest I became 300 for the first time ever. I was beyond depressed, I Felt like I had no real hope. I remember praying for help from God and in late December around Christmas and for a month after I was beyond sick. I think ikt was the flu but it was worse than anything I Had it might have been covid I never got tested I dont &#39;know. But I lost for the first time 34 lbs in one month!<br><br>I found out when I bought some clothes from Victoria secrets I was used to saying that The clothes were too tight it was the first time I saw them loose and too big O_O I was in shock. Around March I think it was God put it on my mind to quit soda that I was badly addicted to then I realized if I&#39;m quitting soda why not chips and candy, I started to see more weight loss a little at a time but I looked a lot thinner because Soda makes you look fatter looking! <br><br>I am at 46 lbs weight lose and i still cant&#39; believe it&#39;s me saying it. I quit chinese food this month cause it made me sick, and I quit pizza and i hate eating out at fast food chains I have actually avoided them as much as possible. But I still ate things that werne&#39;t so great for me. The fact is it&#39;s about forcing yourself to walk away from the things that are not good for you no matter how good they taste. <br><br>I hope and pray tath since I am now quitting bread that I will continue to see the weightloss. I make most of my own meals and I do my best to eat things like whole wheat pasta instaed of the normal one was not filling at all. I also hand cut my own fries and air fry them if I have them, we have a bunch more options between my father and I. I am excited I was 3x now I am large in tees and pjs and in jeans depending on brands 16 to 18!  I would have been 24 in those ones. Anyways again never imagined I could do this. I have never been so grateful to get sick the way I was!<br><br>Don&#39;t give up ever! It&#39;s not worth going back on those. I also avoid cakes and cookies etc. I had no idea about Oreos I&#39;m glad i quit those things. The list is beyond long of what i walked away from and I know that I am going down more and more with each passing day. I Feel beyond healthy! I know I have a long journey ahead but I also know that it&#39;s possible now.l just can&#39;t give up. I wanted to thank you for these videos you made it really clued me in on a lot of things i Did not understand. I am no longer hopeless when it comes to this subject of true health.

If u doctor tells you to lose weight, it&#39;s cuz ur gonna die. That&#39;s not fat phobic.
Revolution seems to have made a perfect dupe of the Miracle Balms , I got 2 shades of the product made by Bobby Brown and it’s exactly what they do. Greasy , sticky , thick , never sinks in.
Fast metabolism buds !! Same! I experience that same exact thing, so I feel you on. Trying to gain weight.
I recently found ur channel bc I was scouring YT for weight loss videos. I love ur content so much! Ur so smart and have such a clear and concise way of communicating ur research. Thank u!
The One Size one performed worse than the ones rated lower. 👀
as someone who is adhd and (was) prediabetic, this is very helpful &lt; 3 im trying to lose weight and understand why i eat the way i do!
They are all stupid and disgusting
The best example that being obese isn&#39;t ok is the sheer amount of people who watch videos like this (and might be reading this) who previously bought into the BoPo slogans that keep you unhealthy and complacent, then said &quot;No more&quot; and &quot;Never again&quot;.<br><br>No amount of rallying the &quot;large and in charge&quot; can persuade people that missing out on your life and your family is worth it.
As a big white guy.......I would like thank and blame myself for the epic late night runs to taco bell. And not enough trips to the gym.....btw it&#39;s my own damn fault but slowly working on it. So I agree with the last guy.....fat people are everywhere and it&#39;s our own fault
Kiana put it best in another video: fat activism in the HAES vein is simply crabs in a bucket syndrome.  How dare anyone in their community better themselves and not stay with the injured herd.
It&#39;s for fat girls only.   Its an extension of the Fat Acceptance movement.  It&#39;s a &quot;Fat Girls Only&quot;  Mean Girls Club.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTLe9kBfO4c&amp;t=9m53s">9:53</a> The HYPOCRISY of saying that these shows degrade people and teach children that those who suffer from obesity are freaks and outcasts, only to say later on that Ableism in “comedy” performances are ‘funny and acceptable’ is truly disgusting; imagine how people that have Special Needs feel when they are ostracized and deemed ‘unwanted’ in any form of media.
And back in the days my mother was like a racer without any preparation, just went into the car, get it ready up and on and drive off like a smooth maniac<br><br>As for my father, we had one time where it took him 10-15 minutes just to get from the parking spot to the gate of the mall which takes only 1-2 minutes if you were to walk there going the same road as the car at the parking spot<br>I love my family
People don&#39;t overeat because they don&#39;t know that overeating is bad. They overeat because they are addicted to the comfort of food. People become addicts because of trauma. They will never stop being fat until they learn a better way to deal with trauma.
A lot of people think that it&#39;s easier to lose weight and eat healthier by eating certain foods and &quot;limiting&quot; junk food, but I have personally found that it&#39;s easier to have at least a general plan for what to eat each day and track all food. It leads me to make food choices based on whether it is worth the calories, both by nutrition and taste (both are important). Evidence that this worked for me: I lost 70 lbs, from 265 to 195 at 6&#39;4&quot;. I did not exercise in any way during this period, although I definitely should have. After I lost the weight I started lifting weights and doing cardio a few times per week and gained back another 25 lbs of lean mass (muscle, water, glycogen) over a year and a half and actually managed to lose more fat mass. Do with this anecdote what you will, but perhaps it will help someone realize there is an approach between trying to make better choices in the moment and complete meal planning.
Im from the Uk. This show Freaky Eaters isn’t good. Neither is SuperSkinny v Supersized.
Omg . This is stupid .all ppl are fat including myself are due to not eating healthy . Lil or no exercise.
We live in a world of excess food and it&#39;s food that creates obesity with sugar and carbohydrates. Unfortunately everyone including the medical world are ignorant and believe the food pyramid is healthy when it was designed by the US Dept of Agriculture to increase sales of wheat, corn, etc. Those parents who are deliberately undermining their kids efforts and destroying their lives are disgusting and I really wanted to kick their arses.
&quot;That&#39;s kinda what we are designed for.&quot; Excuse me? What exactly is it you want to imply here. This woman is working at home on her podcast promoting women&#39;s safety talking about the for left and how women&#39;s rights are being taken away. Are you forgetting that back before electricity was invented everything was made by hand. The women were working they just did it by pretty much making everything the family needed that the husband would never do in his entire life. Plus nurses female nurses that were the closest things to female doctors also existed. It is something that has always existed. Mid wife&#39;s don&#39;t forget hand maids female slaves. Seamstresses and female politicians in royalty. Not to mention elders and nuns any other kind of work that women were able to get. It all depended mostly on their education and class pretty much. You can&#39;t afford education if you have to pay for it and you are poor. No one stops to think about that do they? Be grateful for you got today ladies. If you do not then history is doomed to repeat.
“Why are you so ugly?” <br>“I don’t know!!”<br><br>Love you so much jeffree shine bright queen ❤️
Why is this woman so fat?
Omg whyy!?!?! Get that disgusting piercing out of your beautiful face!
Thank God it&#39;s gone. The fashion industry contributes to so much pollution and environmental hazard and waste, not too mention the exploitation. When big corporations fail, an angel gets its wings. Also, why do you hate fat people?
I believe fat people think that the food they eat is more satisfying and tasty than eating healthily. And eating healthily means eating food they don’t like or even find disgusting. But eating healthily IS more tasty, more fun, makes you feel better and satisfy you because you’re getting the nutrients you need. It gives you more energy to put that mental effort into choosing healthy. Work out how you can make eating healthily part of every day and eventually everything you eat. We are so lucky to have the internet that makes it easy to find healthy, tasty and quick recipes. Also have one or two easy fall-back meals for when you can’t be bothered to choose. For me that is chicken, rice and broccoli (swap out broccoli) for whatever vegetable you like if you don’t like broccoli.
Wtf who beats their kid over makeup….I literally thought that was a joke that’s freaking disgusting.
They don&#39;t have to relinquish power. They have to be forced out. No one should be there for more than eight years and there should be no grandfathering. As for John Fetterman, he&#39;s just plain retarded
She is a disgusting human being! Activists like this should never hold office!
freddy was doing the most to keep her fat even like taking the fall for her on lies<br>you think he might have a feeder fetish?
They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re just lying to avoid accountability. Disgusting.
Fat parents tend to raise fat kids. The parents fail because they&#39;re full of sad excuses. They blame the air for being too cold to go for a walk, blame not having enough time, and blame others for something. Fat people never take on their own responsibility. It&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault they&#39;re fat.
That’s gross 🤮 keep it to yourself lady
Sooooo now all the muscular torsos moved to Instagram where they get massive following …. Glad k was never ugly and sanctimonious ….
Why don&#39;t women stop breeding with ugly men? I guess someone&#39;s gotta pay the bills
the tea confiscated my tub of cocoa butter for being a tiny bit oversized
Not me bawling at Amy crying at getting weight loss surgery…<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whoscuttingonions">#whoscuttingonions</a>
lolol girl shows a picture of when she is a little bit chubby and says she knows how it is to be fat.. laaaawl.. wtf
Hm I don&#39;t agree with many points here. Because a &quot;controlled&quot; Binge eating IS having control. The most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when the blood sugar drops so much that it&#39;s a body&#39;s mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things. But the thing you said with school is a whole different topic. For a diet it&#39;s bad, but for keeping your weight it&#39;s good.<br><br>I did this most of my school time while having hashimoto (which means my metabolismn is so bad that I get weight fast and lose weight hard) but I had my rule , first of all I never in my life eating breakfast if I have to wake up early, I had rule that if I have 6 hours school I eat and drink nothing during that time, if I have longer like 8 or 9 hours I will eat one apple. And this I continued like 7 years (?) and - it was fine. In the evening I ate tons of trash , huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly. Because it was like remaining in control during the day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy, and in evening you reward yourself for it. And I never gained any kg of weight during all the years. Of course I didn&#39;t lose neither, but also not gained weight. <br><br>So I disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar.
My 20-year-old niece keeps gaining weight and doesn’t care. Her mother can’t mention the weight gain or she yells back - don’t body shame me. Dangerous, selfish message.
the weight you lose would be the money in your pocket
I honestly don&#39;t see the appeal of mukbangs in general, and Nikocado&#39;s channel in particular. The eating is just gross, and even if you found it entertaining, if he does this every day, doesn&#39;t it get boring really quickly? Secondly, it seems impossible to know what&#39;s genuine with this guy.
This obese influencer is a grifter . She could easily lose weight if she lost her sense of taste.
Such exaggeration that fat people  cancelled Abercrombie it was in bad state after the great recession in 2008. As it was to expensive for the average teenager or young person.Bud light is a somewhat modern comparison.
Piers Morgan is real trash... he literally just tried to belittle a fellow reporter, in the heat of the fight, in Gaza.. It was disgusting.  That reporter put him in his place.
I don’t understand the attraction of watching videos of people gorging on piles of disgusting food. It’s so gross 🤮
I had a friend who lost a significant amount of weight. Despite how much I wanted to lose weight, but failing miserably though now I&#39;m down 70 pounds and just a little more to go, I only felt happy for her. While I do wish to be skinny and what not, I just can&#39;t see myself getting upset at someone for putting the work into getting fit. I also want bigger breast but I don&#39;t hate my friends who have a bigger chest than me. I think it also comes down to maturity levels as well. I can&#39;t see a mature person getting that angry and jealous over someone else&#39;s success. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s just what I think. Just because I hate my body and self, doesn&#39;t mean that I wouldn&#39;t want someone else to stay unhealthy either. That&#39;s just weird. I took my issue and turned it into motivation to try to get me to lose weight. I just want to finally feel pretty, or at least don&#39;t feel like a whale. I probably will always feel that way but still. That and I want to find a man who will love me, even though I know it&#39;s a far fetched fantasy. It&#39;s so far beyond fantasy that it&#39;s not even in the realm of any world.
The Darkstar (hypersonic aircraft shown in the beginning of the movie) may not be a real plane, but it certainly looks like a part of it—so much so that the Navy told Top Gun producer, and legendary filmmaker, Jerry Bruckheimer, that China is reorienting its spy satellite to catch a glimpse of their full-size clone designed to filming. The Navy said that &quot;The Chinese satellite turned and took a different route to photograph the plane. They thought it was real. That&#39;s how it really looks like,” Bruckheimer told Sandboxx News.
I just watched this movie last night and I was disgusted by it. “Your friendly neighborhood - call a social worker - Spider-Man… The entire story could have been avoided by Peter being rational and sending them back to their timelines. I did not like the woke “but I can fix them,” or “everyone deserves a second chance.” How’d that work out for May? What other problems did he cause in the multiverse by changing fate. The motto is “With great power, comes great responsibility.” What about the responsibility in altering fate in other universes? Isn’t that an abuse of power to satisfy one’s own selfish need to fix something? That’s irresponsible. Besides that, I did love having all three generations of Spider-Man together, as corny as their lines were at times, it made the movie worth watching.
How many 600 lb actors are there actually? You could not have this film without a fat suit. Like you said expecting an actor to gain that much weight is insane. So, in this situation I am pro fat suit.
I watch no Disney movie ever again. They are corrupt disgusting people
1 cookie will NEVER make anyone fat. A conveyor belt of anything will.
We actually just NEED to turn our Backs On Movies in general!!! If you pay to watch or Buy a Movie You ARE Donating Your Money To The Disgusting Human And Sex Trafficking!!! You Absolutely ARE making it POSSIBLE For These People To Be Able To Commit These Atrocious Acts!!! Stop FUNDING Human/Sex Trafficking!!! Stop FUNDING The Woke Bull Shat!!! You, Reading this, YOUR MONEY IS ABSOLUTELY PAYING FOR THEIR SLAVES AND THEIR TRAFFICKING OF THESE HUMAN SLAVES!!! YOU ARE MAKING IT AFFORDABLE FOR THEM!!! STOP FUNDING THESE POS FOOKWAD WASTES OF OXYGEN!!!
I&#39;m in pretty good shape, my stomach lost it&#39;s six pack and is now just a flat stomach, I have to ride my bike up a moderately steep hill for about a mile after work to get to where I stay so my legs are in good shape, so I guess I&#39;m fatphobic lol, even though I&#39;ve seen some women who have a few extra pounds that I&#39;ve found attractive.
Just shows how children do not hold the love from their mother of the same value as from their father. The father always gets to be the cool parents who brings shit from McDonalds, meanwhile the mother does the actual job of parenting, household chores, disciplining, cooking, telling them to do the homework, while the overweight father gets to enjoy tv and leave the dishes on the table
Big girl here, wouldn’t wear anything more than a bikini for swimming, because fat girl swimsuits are made for beach wales.  They put far too much cloth to look modest, but all that material ain’t comfortable for swimming and definitely not staying indefinitely wet in. Women who wear something like that typically won’t take a splash of water.
The one thing about binge eating for me was that I felt like I had to rush my meals. I grew up being asked to hurry up and cram my mouth with heaps of rice so I could be allowed to leave the dining table. As an adult, I had developed this habit well until last year, when I learnt to slow down and take my time. Not only does it help me be aware of how full I am, it also reminds me to actually taste my food. Another thing that I learnt by doing that was how salty my meals actually were. I was stuffing myself with so much carbs and MSG (think rice, thick sauces and deep fried dishes). Now I try to eat cleaner and it has reduced that heavy bloated feeling and I feel that this small habit has made such a huge change in my eating/diet mindset.
I don&#39;t think I can tell someone how to lose weight since I&#39;ve never had these problems. But if I was to give an advice it would be to reduce the amount of unhealthy habits and intentionaly create good habits. Like for example last year I realised that after finishing university andstarting work I was getting in a worse shape over time. When that happened I didn&#39;t go to gym. Instead I started jogging like 1-2 km a day, did like 10 push ups and that was it. I also started intentionally avoiding any unhealthy food. Reasonably though. I try to eat mostly home made meals or something in fancy restaurants that it whole food, nothing artificially processed. Other than that. I eat aa much as I feel like and have greatly incresed the amount of exercises. Now I feel much better. It&#39;s going back to 16-18 year old body when I was sorta athletic (nothing special though, but could do about 25-30 pull ups for example). I think it is a good way to improve your health in a long run. Just avoid extreams.
5th highest grossing movie in Australian history so far. The Hans Zimmer score is 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The only woman who exercises and is still fat.
I know it&#39;s not really related, but for the first kid who wanted to play in the NFL, offensive and defensive linemen are usually very overweight and it&#39;s the &quot;peak shape&quot; for their position. You even see some of them after they retire they shed off so much weight cause they&#39;re no longer eating 4000+ calories a day
🎀Thé brush you used for your bronzer looks so soft and plush.🎀
This is the single biggest problem today is the little girls of 20 and 30 years ago that never had any discipline or guidance from their fathers are now adults and nothing but 304s.. no wifie material for the guys to marry, just 304s..
I am so fucking disgusting When I see the title like “Socialism vs Capitalism” . As an escapee escaped from CCP China which is in dictatorship. I really really wish those people who love socialism they must go CCP China to feel the iron fist of socialism
I used to love Disney. But just as Ben says.. they&#39;re ruining everything we grew up with and doing it blatantly in our faces. They have gone so woke.. it&#39;s disgusting.
god damnit i am crying ugly tears at tammy&#39;s &quot;i sure the hell did!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m worth it!&quot; she was so sad and hurt and didn&#39;t value her life before i feel like an old friend conquered a terminal illness fr omfg. YES TAMMY
they really think if you don&#39;t blindly agree with them on everything then that means you hate fat people. jfc make it make sense.
Obese people generally live off the government they don&#39;t contribute to society it&#39;s a drain on social security
fun fact , if you just dance around while playing music you can lose alot of weight. i dont do any real styles but just copy 1% of what belly dancer do and youll have alot of fun. also check out different indian schools of dance. if youre religious or non specific religious , i highly recommend it. alot of indian dance is actually prayers, thank yous, and blessings to gods. whenever i dance , i like to imagine myself at the foot of a behemoth throne , gold and surrounded by clouds, and my creator watches over me as i dance for them like a baby horse learning to walk. it brings me great joy. and i hope it bring you joy as well. my heart is pounding from happiness
I don’t understand why would you think that you’re not eating enough. Like, then where do you think all this weight came from??
have you seen virgin mountain? it doesnt focus on the fat issue a lot but i really liked the movie
Your videos are so helpful to me on my weight loss journey. They help me to stay focused on my goals❤
Those of y&#39;all who don&#39;t know, as of 2023 she has had weight loss surgery, lost over 300 lbs and gotten married!! SLAYY MISS TAMMY SLAAAY
Well my mum left me  for another man Because he didn’t want a child. And my father was an alcoholic. My grandma brought me up but not love, she was very annoyed most of the time. No wonder I<br>Always ended up with abusive men in a relationship. Maybe I’m screwed up for life then
I’m a recovering alcoholic, and because I drank my calories, I have a very complicated relationship with food. The idea of being addicted to eating, something you HAVE to do to stay alive, is really scary, because I know what it feels like to THINK you need your substance. Food addicts NEED to eat, like anyone else. If I had to take a couple shots every day, I would never stop drinking. I’m trying really hard to unlearn my judgement of overweight people: genetics and the science of fattening food has a lot to do with it, but I also remember how I felt when I drank thousands of calories of whiskey a week. The world is scary and sucks and it’s getting worse, and we all cope in different ways.
The best example that being obese isn&#39;t ok is the sheer amount of people who watch videos like this (and might be reading this) who previously bought into the BoPo slogans that keep you unhealthy and complacent, then said &quot;No more&quot; and &quot;Never again&quot;.<br><br>No amount of rallying the &quot;large and in charge&quot; can persuade people that missing out on your life and your family is worth it.

Given the disclosures in the past 18 months the sad part is that especially for teens the misery is the feature not the glitch. Apparently depression and clicking on eating disorder content happens with alarming rapidity on these platforms. It can be fatal for some. Filters add to the discrepancy-percieved between the &quot;ideals&quot; and the self. Leaving the ordinary user in the painful thrall of social com parison theory. G
oh gosh I love hourglass, but that concealer is sooo  thick and &#39;makeup-y&#39;.  not a fan.
I am on the 8th day of my water fast and I went from overweight* to a normal bmi- lost 16 lbs.<br><br> I&#39;ve gotten 4x as many smiles, way more stares, &quot;have a good days&quot; from strangers... makes me feel like maybe I am also biased towards overweight people.
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
As a Russian citizen, who lived most of my life in Moscow and actively opposed Putin, I can say that Putin&#39;s actions aren&#39;t as calculated and strategic as it may seem.<br><br>He is a senile dictator. Not much different from African warlords, really. The big difference is that he has a much more organized corruption group who runs the whole country and steals from the nation on scale that&#39;s really difficult to immagine. He controlls the media in Russia and covers his people who steal from any government controlled industry in the country. <br><br>His invasion of Ukraine is a gross miscalculation: <br>- He underestimated the people of Ukraine. His intel told him that Ukranians would welcome Russian army and will actually greet them with flowers. Instead,  his troops encountered people who would die rather than surrender their lands and homes.<br>- He overestimated his troops. Decades of corruption and stealing left his army poorly equiped, badly trained, and ill-motivated. <br>- His plan relied on taking Kiev in three days (that was officially said by a lot of Russian media when the war started), and changing the government there. Now that he failed, he improvises, but his reign left him a country that&#39;s easy to rule, but hard to make efficient. Production, international affairs, mobilisation and even propaganda - all of that is crumbling.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t mean that he isn&#39;t dangerous or that people of Russia have any realistic chance of dethroning him any time soon, but that means that he is heading towards his inevitable defeat. <br>We can only hope that this madman won&#39;t resort to nuclear weapons to go down with a bang.
The US of A is going rapidly into decline, and nowhere is this more obvious than in their so-called culture wars. Its citizens are encouraged to become unhealthily mega-fat through its addiction to mega-consumption, then the poor slobs are shamed for being unhealthily mega-fat, then the same slobs are told, no, it is beautiful to be unhealthily mega-fat... because the fashion labels say so and they want Walmart to share a bit of the XXL clothing market. Just keep those muffin and McFlurry supply lines going 🤣🤣
30 years ago,, people didnt get fat from eating food... now  look at the american population....whats changed?....  food quality... amounts... sitting around
the weight you lose would be the money in your pocket
Who is the British person responsible for arbitrating the weight of “a stone”?
I dont want to sound like im thinking that im a &quot;healthy example&quot;, because im not (bmi 16, not anorexic or anything). But i never understood &quot;binge eating&quot;, like why? Also i love making my own food, if there is a way for me to make it from scratch, i will do it (for example my own pasta, or my own burger buns or just anything, i like knowing what i eat (maybe im just autistic, because i also like knowing what medicine i take, i really dont like taking some pills without knowing what is the main substance in them and how it affects my body)). The think that i believe is the most unhealth thing in my diet is that i dont have schedule for eating, i just eat when i feel hungry, sometimes (most often when im spending whole day in front of a pc (programmer)) i can get by on single sandwich per day, other times i can eat 4 course meal and still feel hungry. My favorite meals are toasts, avocado toast, toasts with &quot;skagenröra&quot; (Swedish prawn salad), or just toast with some type of cold meat and tomato with mozzarella and a bit of olive oil. Like i said i dont want say that im a &quot;healthy example&quot;, because im not, but i believe that im more healthy than most americans (sorry, dont feel ofended, i know you probably will), but i dont think that BMI is very good measurement for &quot;healty&quot;, just like i dont believe that iq is good measurement for &quot;intelligence&quot;, but whole my life i was on the skinny side. (Guy, 185cm and around 55-60kg, i never in my life were above 65kg, never had health problems caused by my diet. I dont go ty gym, but i have active lifestyle, 15,000 steps per day is little for me, love biking). @KianaDocherty what is your opinion about my lifestyle?<br><br>edit: Today im 20 years old, 185cm and 62kg. BMI of 18.1 (0% underweight)
I discovered this mechanism myself in pandemic. Sent to home office, I liked it first. Then, after a few weeks I thought I am gonna die from back pain. Being a person who used to cycle to work every single day and generally move a lot, I had terrible back pains and felt exhausted like an old lady (being 34 at that time). I called my GP and they prescribed me some pain killers but I realized that if something doesn&#39;t change, I would end up as a hospital patient 😢<br><br>Being imprisoned at home, I bought myself accessories for gym, an ergonomic chair and started to re-invent gym at home. It went so well I even had to take a break because I stretched my back too much 😂 <br><br>From now on, I observe this phenomena very closely on myself. I move = All is good. I stop moving for a longer time, my backbone, joints and feet start to get painful. So I keep regular exercise habits not only to be fit and skinny but to stay healthy. It&#39;s not a whim, it&#39;s staying alive 😊<br>I feel better than most of my younger friends who complain non stop about their pains and how movement hurts.
Im a nurse, 90% of my patients this size are completely immobile. Trapped in bed, unable to even turn back and forth in bed when someone changes their diaper. We use essentially metal cranes in order to lift them. So for people to say this is a derogatory depiction, most people of this size could not even open the door to grab that pizza. Like get a grip on yourself before publicly reviewing something with such a skewed outlook
Maybe we have a different recipe in my country, but Diet Coke is just disgusting and it’s not popular at all
I don&#39;t count my calories or my carbs. I eat when I want, and I eat primarily healthy. Who cares about calories, it&#39;s not  sustainable to keep that up. Keto what? I just eat %2 processed food and the rest is fresh. I am 5&#39;3 and between a size 2 and a size 4 any given day. I am also 31 and have birthed one child. People need to eat more healthier to stay healthier and happier. Stop eating crap and you will feel good.
Well I am lazy and old ugly and fat. Relatives healthy exercise  clean eaters and most not past 50 before they kill over. 53 still breathing for now
My experience with body immage issues began in the 7th grade when we had nutrition lessons in biology and i started being less of a picky eater. This resulted in me getting a bit more chubby. It wasn&#39;t bad it was just going from scrawny and short to a bit more chubby with a bit of a belly and still short. Due to being bullied already cause I was quick to anger they just found a new avenue for ridicule. This lessened with time especially after some of them left the school or got chill but it popped up from now and then with comments about me bulking(some of them were weigh into fittnes and gym.) Fortunatly due to a combination of me being too lazy to go to the gym, me being fixated on school and gaming, getting therapy for my Anger issues(turns out I have aspergers) and my belly not being the primary source of ridicule I avoided my body image issues developing into some sort of eating disorder. <br>I know I am not the worst off. I just wanted to share my story and play the world smallest violin. (Great song from ajr. )
The bite-sized fork experimentally welcome because grass phenotypically surround pro a dreary sword.  foamy, muddled bulb
As someone who was very overweight in middle school, I got my life together in 9th grade, stopped failing, stopped stammering and then ended up heading debate in school, and ended up earning admission to an Ivy League college. All because I was able to make that one choice - to get healthy. This gave me enough confidence to see myself as something more than weight. I was able to be my best self. This hit home. Thank you.
I like the protein % given. I think  informing people of good nutrition fats ( that would total about 70%) they will not have any insulin response and give you a total satiated feeling with the most energy.  cholesterol is no longer a problem by FDA. check out a Carnivore diet for healthy eating and super fast weight loss. Low carb high fat. no factory processed  oils.
Where is fat influencer now?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV55Ocz-jII&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> what&#39;s up with this form of taking insulin? It&#39;s not the first time that i see people take up the bottle and use a syringe..... but it is STRANGE!!!<br>like.. don&#39;t they have pre-filled pens? Is that only a Europe thing? Just saying because it looks like a very very cumbersome way to administer insulin.<br>@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV55Ocz-jII&amp;t=3m50s">3:50</a> .... Why?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
It’s great that you have had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kKUTWZSg8&amp;t=3m03s">3:03</a>  so much success. As much you motivate and encourage others to succeed on their journeys to health, that is a great thing. <br>I believe that obesity is unhealthy. The research does show that there is a strong genetic component to obesity. There are also significant socioeconomic indicators of health that underlie obesity. My knowledge of obesity is that it is a result of a complex combination of factors. It’s not just a matter of personal willpower or inner strength. <br>In fact, my view of many obese people is that they have tried multiple times to lose weight, and that it takes tremendous courage to keep trying, even if failure seems likely. I respect them for that, and would never demean anyone for failure. <br>Yes, obesity can be overcome, it’s not impossible, but this will never occur as a result of<br>any kind of denigration.<br>Again, since your videos inspire others in a positive manner, I applaud you.
Parents are to blame they don&#39;t educate themselves or learn how to cook, obestiality is everywhere,, Mac Donald&#39;s being the worst out let for junk food,  children are not born fat, it&#39;s the parents fault for being uneducated and lazy fact
Bu yedikleri yiyecekler bu kadar sorun yaritiyorsa bence bu zararli yiyecekleri bir daha yürtmese insanlarda bu kadar zarar görmez.
My 20-year-old niece keeps gaining weight and doesn’t care. Her mother can’t mention the weight gain or she yells back - don’t body shame me. Dangerous, selfish message.
That’s a VP?  No!  That is disgusting &amp; unprofessional.  An embarrassment to my country.
Now, it is utterly BOLLOCKS to claim that obesity is caused by poverty that in turn leads to a lack of money to buy nutritious food.<br><br>If you are poor, you will not even have access to junk food.<br><br>In the more intelligent East where I come from, obesity is known as a rich person&#39;s plight. We have a euphemism here to describe an overweight person. We would often say in jest, &#39;Wow. Long time no see. You look prosperous now.&#39;<br><br>Most baby boomers and their parents, the interwar generation, were never overweight. Many were skinny or even ripped, to use today&#39;s adjective.<br><br>My paternal grandparents were a tad better off than my maternal grandparents. And you can tell by their physicality. My paternal grandfather went to the elite schools. He became a watercolour artist and a pioneer in my country for drawing the nude female form. Even his vocation was bourgeois. He was not fat but on the plump side.<br><br>My mother&#39;s father had formal schooling up to only nine or ten years old. He was a street food hawker. And he was scrawny.<br><br>Hmm. The bourgeois grandfather lived to 73. The scrawny grandfather? 96. And he started to have dementia only after 90.
It&#39;s the toxins in the food plus the unnecessary additives
You explained the concept of intuitive eating quite precisely ;). And although you might speak quite critically about HAES in one of your videos, you just pointed out some of the main principles around HAES food advice :). Eat when you&#39;re hungry. Stop when you&#39;re full. Include feel-good movement. Eat fibre. Enjoy your meal with all senses.  What a certain Instagram culture made of this inclusive movement and its good intention ... well, I share your criticism at some point. By the way these principles equal the principles of Intuitive Eating (such facts combined with audios for subconscious changes). 1. Eat when you&#39;re hungry. 2. Eat what makes you feel happy and healthy. 3. Enjoy your meal and trust your hunger signals. 4. Stop when you feel adequalely satiated. Started both HAES theory and Intuitive Eating practice to get back in line with my body and to make peace with it. Most ironically, lost weight with it. Now I&#39;m combining both aspects and write about HAES and body-related topics in my blog,, among other topics  :). Another fun fact at this point ... In earlier times, social pressure and negative feelings led to emotional eating (my Intuitive Eating programme steps into the subconscious part of emotional eating) and since I have been practising this idea (theoretically it was known to me through HAES), the same negative emotions result in  total lack of appetite so I must force myself to eat then. Sorry long post - but might be helpful for you :).
I&#39;m a young guy who never watched the original top gun, but I went and watched it right before this film, seeing the two back to back was great, sure I personally liked maverick better, but that was not at the cost of the previous film. Maverick was brilliant and engaging the whole time, and the fighter jet scenes as re some of the most exhilarating action in recent years. It feels like there&#39;s so much on the line and one misstep one possible iota of miscalculation and the mission fails. They do a real good job of making the audience feel the weight of this mission, which ultimately pays off so well. And of course no woke garbage, just good film making.
What I do is use a mini spatula to break down the broken makeup even more into super small pieces, and then I use the flat end of a super fat brush or brush cover to tamp down the small pieces, to make a whole pan. This technique also applies when my pressed powder is almost gone, but I want to save the small slivers that break away from the corners of the pan. I just have a small tub specially for the purpose, and save the slivers onto it.
A) Do not buy, then it is not there to eat.<br>B) Remember the following are borring food that are getting you fat, do avoid 100%: rice, pasta, bread and potatoes.
I dint know what&#39;s more: &quot;depressing or plain stupidity&quot;. Peorple like this woman, push for an ideal, which is actually more self defeating to their race/culture. Muslims in the U.S.A. is a perfect example. Muslims in this country are here, because it&#39;s a better life. The kind of life, the world of Islam which would deny them all the freedoms and prosperities they take for granted here! As for gays, feminists and far lefts? Don&#39;t even get me started.

MFs really out here measuring weight in fucking stones
Hello my name is Quinton Merritt , I&#39;m a complete idiot and a perfect example of the downfall of America. Everybody around me has confirmed my ignorance plus I wear a wifebeater and i have a predator haircut!
Trump&#39;s reduction of taxes for the wealthy, who were already profiting from tax breaks and hoarding their fortunes, has already negatively affected our economy and infrastructure. We must not only roll back those cuts, but tax the rich and reduce taxes of the poor!  Equity for all.  Capitalism has led to this unfair tax system which has fueled autocracy and greed, and the normalizing of unaccountability.
Why is there so much obsession and discussion about fat people ?  <br><br>Why do others care so much about other people’s  weight ?  I seriously don’t get it .  <br><br>Can someone explain please .
I wish my parents knew how bad and unhealthy fast food was before they ended up obese
Stop complaining ! It’s like jail and expensive ? Good let that be a lesson to them and especially they’re parents to maybe look at the food they are eating . It’s not like they were forced to get obese .
Has anyone problems with setting spray making their hair gross ?
size might not matter but do you know what does ? the age of consent ❤
“Okay well first of all if we are going to talk about triggers, social media in and of itself is a GIANT trigger” <br><br>YES, agreed Demi! 🙌🏻
On the topic of food ordering apps- I’m on the other end of the spectrum, anorexia binge/purge subtype. I developed a huge shame in people seeing me in relation to food, and I hated purging in public restrooms. I dont have a car, either, so picking up food from my favorite binge spots in near impossible where I live. So, I turned to food delivery apps. They made me spiral to crazy levels. I was binging and purging multiple times everyday, I was spending absurd amounts of money on food and delivery. And because of this, I was investing even less food than normal, as my time was taken up binging and purging, so I lost even more weight. It was a dark time in my life. I swore off food delivery. If I want to binge and purge, I have to go get it. And that has dramatically decreased the frequency. My general consensus- food delivery apps are bad for EVERYONE. It should not be so easy to get food.
That&#39;s what my father did. Now I&#39;m engaged to a man who is terrified by the idea of having a girl. I sincerely believe by the time our children are old enough to have these social issues, the world will be past some of this, thanks to good people who got involved, like Brett.
the only problem with your stupid bs argument Ben is that your basis for it is based in some made up bullshit about a floaty dude in the sky that lives in a castle of gold and if you worship him enough you will go there when you die. You supporting the ABOLISHMENT of ALL FORMS OF ABORTION means that women who are going to have a fatal delivery, or a child that will be born into pain and disability and never have a life worth living, all those options to abort DANGEROUS pregnancies will go with it. you are a fkn idiot to say that there is no legitimacy in ANY abortion.
Wait isnt brittain kind of obese too?
wasn&#39;t there a video of a woman who danced inappropriately at her fathers funeral or something as well?
When you are lifting weights concentrate on pushing your bellybutton to your spine. Concentrate on your core. This will help with your neck issue.
This is actually a true face of depression. It&#39;s not being sad with some sad music in your head as they portrait it in movies. Nope. It&#39;s anger, it&#39;s personality degrading, it&#39;s tantrums, it&#39;s derealisation, it&#39;s loosing any connection with people around you. People do not like that part of depression. It&#39;s ugly and horrifying illness which will make your whole personality rott.
Claiming that it is physically impossible to lose weight when millions of people regularly do it every single day is nothing short of complete and utter delusion.
It doesn’t seem like you really understand the psychology of being an overweight person or what body positivity is (though as well as some obese people you show in your videos). Your channel looks like you are just one of those fat shaming people who don’t understand that talking about health consequences is not helping at all. What helps these people is not just things like  “stop eating”, “move more” or “pull yourself together and just do it” but love and supporting environment , activities they actually like doing, a good therapist, respectful attitude, supporting family etc. Because food addiction always has something to do  with guilt, stress coping, eating up emotions because of inability to deal with them, childhood traumas and low self esteem and other “benefits” from being overweight for our brain. If I were you I’d rather stop just shaming fat people or do superiority talk on how you were overweight and point out the other real side of the problem. Why people get obese and why fat activist became what it is today.
I hate to say this, but for the longest time I honestly thought Tammy just didn’t have it in her to lose the weight.  I was so happy when she proved me wrong ❤
did you ever watch Super Size VS Super Skinny? that was a great uk diet show, just about every person was a success. a really great format
Causing people to lose weight by weaponizing their laziness? That&#39;s genius!
I’ve been a bit too skinny my whole life and I have to credit my parents for having me grow up very healthy, I couldn’t imagine my life without being Athletic. Although tbf I acually need to gain weight and idk how people do it I get full after a reg portion meal and fast food just tastes so bad I’d rather skip a meal than eat at mcd or Wendy’s
It helped me to move out and not live with my mom anymore. I stopped binge eating and cook my own. But I couldn&#39;t lose weight so I had surgery 2 weeks ago and I have no problems sticking with the dïet that comes with it.
With a 60 plus percent chance of divorce with an 80 percent chance she files ya miss me with all that.   This isn’t 1950.  The world has changed and marriage is irrelevant.
Tammy will never change period! Even if she is in care and loses a lot of weight gets the surgery she will just gain it all back and more. She is drawn to men who like huge women and boom she will do anything for them what&#39;s sad is she won&#39;t do that for herself .
Why would you give this gross racist a platform.
Not only is being fat unattractive, it’s bad for your health. Who knew.
I found your videos though Megan Anne about a week or two ago, and I&#39;ve been straight BINGEING your content ever since 😭<br>So I have a few things to say:<br>1. I LOVE your hair 2 years ago with the highlights 🤩😍 okrrrrrt<br>2. Your channel has finally, COMPLETELY removed the victim mentality from my life. (I can&#39;t lie, Andrew Tate actually gave me the initial push I needed, you&#39;ve given me the final shove I clearly needed.)<br>3. Since watching your videos, I&#39;ve begun writing down goals, shifting my thought processes, and analyzing myself quite differently than before. It&#39;s noticeable!!<br>4. I&#39;ve never been too &quot;overweight&quot; (I&#39;m 5&#39; 4&quot;, never been more than 150 and that was back in 5th grade; I&#39;m 31 now and 134 lbs) but your content on food makes me realize that I most likely have an unhealthy relationship with food anyway, that weight doesn&#39;t always mark health when it&#39;s thin we&#39;re looking at. <br><br>I apologize for the length of this comment but I&#39;m like 20 videos deep and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said any of this<br><br>And finally, 5. You are my new most favorite, go-to YouTuber!<br><br>Oh, and 6 is a question: I needed braces my entire life, but my mum and I didn&#39;t realize we could afford them until I was in high school, when I was too embarrassed to get them. I said, &quot;I&#39;ll just get adult braces🫣&quot; but here I am, in my 30s, afraid of the pain, the drooling, the headgear, the awkward sex stuff...can you tell me if it&#39;s terrible as all that? Or am I just freaking myself out? 🥺 They fit you so well so I&#39;m wondering if maybe there&#39;s a chance they&#39;re not that bad ?<br><br>Thanks for all your effort and labor! You&#39;re teaching so many people so much 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍♥️🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
This man’s inner pain is so plainly on display, his poor self-image translated into a horrible obsession for his brand. In his mind he must’ve carried an ugly self-image that he just couldn’t shake, so instead he leaned into the whole premise of his brand. Leaned in hard, and of course the end result was gross, disturbing even.
I HATE ticks. Disgusting little assholes. I had Lyme disease and it wasn&#39;t fun at all. 0/10 can&#39;t recommend.
fat fuck: being fat is hard :( i can&#39;t move, i have diabetes, i can&#39;t walk T_T its so haaaaaard....*cries*<br>also the fat fuck: THE 60 BOXES OF PIZZAS IS NOT ENOUGH I NEED MORE FOOD!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4FCoMsLr_s&amp;t=12m05s">12:05</a> To say it&#39;s not at all about willpower, but rather strategy or something else, isn&#39;t true. You&#39;re normally rational, but as is commonly the case, when people get blinded by commercialism (e.g. selling a product, in this case your program) their objectivity and respect for the truth become compromised. Plus their wording becomes less precise and filled with absolutes.<br><br>People can easily control the elephant. For example, stop eating, m@sturbating (nofap) etc. using willpower alone. For example, I was addicted to sugar, especially soda, but started having reactive hypoglycemia. it was manageable and I wasn&#39;t yet diabetic, but I gave it up without issue for years. I even store it cold in my fridge for my family and never drink it despite it being visible, cool and easily accessible.<br><br>I&#39;m not bragging. I&#39;m simply pointing out that almost everyone is capable of immediately and permanently ending a lifelong addiction cold turkey using willpower alone, even if the stakes aren&#39;t all that high (e.g. annoying, but manageable, episodes of reactive hypoglycemia). Not reaching for junk food, having binges and so on can easily be done by anyone. By no stretch of the imagination is this comparable to trying to fight a far stronger animal like an elephant. That&#39;s a gross exaggeration and a perfect example of defeatism, the blame game etc.
Size matters thats why you dont get importance
I really hope this interview and other interviews of similar experiences will make the proper changes it needs for the fashion community and the model community. Very disheartening to hear that is how people of any size, colour, culture are treated. Thank you Ashley for shining a light on where it matters most ❤️

I still can&#39;t get over how Irina had the audacity to call anyone ugly when she&#39;s not exactly the best looking both inside and out. Must suck to have absolutely nothing attractive about you. If anyone&#39;s a loser, it&#39;s her.
Calorie deficit + 10k-12k steps a day, and you will lose weight almost effortlessly
Ok ummm why are yall mad about this,  there are brands that only do black shades and deep tones and everyone loves it but heaven forbid a white person make a foundation collection that is light toned...i don&#39;t get it. we are all the same they can make only white shades and they can make only black shades. get over it find another foundation. Plus the brand isn&#39;t saying &quot;this foundation has every single shade ever made and we has all shades for everyone!!&quot; they never said that they said &quot;we are gonna make a foundation collection.&quot; chill people. stop acting like this is the worst thing ever and they need to be cancelled because honestly yall acting like that is the only foundation on earth and we will all die if there are more white shades then black shades.
They need to get that doctor down in Texas that yells at them fat bodies. He’s just brutal…🤠
I hate to see those toxic ass parents, I had issues with ADHD and overeating and never really had supportive parents didn’t lose weight until I was older and that only happened because I replaced my eating disorder with substance abuse. Addiction really sucks be it food, drugs, gambling, money and many other things. I really wish you had to get a license to procreate because many parents are horrible people.
Wth is &quot;supersize&quot; lol. Almost as if they are trying to cover up or feel good about being obese AF.
Again I don’t think it’s a skinny world I think Hollywood ski place but you guys are normal every day women I don’t understand why this is so crazy but I think it would be hard being in Hollywood and being my size which is a size 8/10
Good luck marrying a women after 25 with 10 plus partners...
Yea it’s not that gross when women you don’t know have hairy pits, most men have hairy pits I mean if she was a attractive model yea it’d be weird but not something to trip over.
It’s not just choices. When nutritious food is way more expensive than cheap junk food, then something is wrong. Those who don’t have the income end up fatter and malnourished.
Man shes got a big gut thick all over
Notice that the men are fit and the women are fat. The bar is so incredibly low for women. It also goes for their personality, the bar is set incredibly low for women. Being a woman is western society is so incredibly easy, all that they have to do to be considered attractive is not eat too much.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFHqiHQgF8&amp;t=3m47s">3:47</a> it means that having 0/ body fat is not healthy BUT HAVING 500 POUNS OF FAT ITS NOT HEALTY EATHER
Honest question...what are protein bars for? Or shakes? Or powders?Are they snacks or meals? Do you only eat them if you go to the gym. I know you&#39;re supposed to eat protein to lose weight but honestly, I have no idea what that means. I just keep it under a certain amount of calories
Like...like...i&#39;m all for plus sized women as long as like...like  not mentioning me!
adhd, binge eater here!!! my biggest help has been MEAL PREPPING and SWAPPING things that have sugar that i can eat sugar free, and NOT BUYING the foods, since for me out of sight, out of mind helps a little :).<br>so things like mayo, ranch, jelly, peanut butter, bread, ice cream, get them low sodium, sugar and fat free. <br>food like that doenst need extra sugar or fats, and you dont need the extra sugar or carbs.<br>my current binge struggle is now in 2023, fastfood is easier to get with  a push of a button :))))))))
I have tattoos for people I love. One for my late grandfather, one for my late grandmother, one for my dog who passed away. Oh and one that I actually do regret getting a little 😂 but I plan on covering it up or removing it eventually. And I will be getting two more small tattoos, one for each of my sons.
Everytime I was this channel, I&#39;m so glad that I started forcing myself to workout daily back in sept. &#39;22. It was never for weight loss, just to maintain my health.   The workout may only be 30-45mins./day, but my emotional regulation &amp; well being, my cognitive reasoning, and my flexibility/mobility have improved greatly.  Even though most of the exercises I use are for balance, &amp; range of motion, I&#39;ve managed to gain a small amount of muscle weight &amp; muscular endurance along the way.  My only regret is that I didn&#39;t start sooner
NGL, the dudes in that &#39;too skinny&#39; line-up look completely normal &amp; healthy to me. And not that they are &#39;too skinny&#39; at all.<br>Now some of the ladies that were in that same line-up, I could see that in some of them.
Parents are to blame they don&#39;t educate themselves or learn how to cook, obestiality is everywhere,, Mac Donald&#39;s being the worst out let for junk food,  children are not born fat, it&#39;s the parents fault for being uneducated and lazy fact
The second fast food kid is fat because both her parents are fat.
So we’ve come full circle. We used to make fun of fat people cause they were lazy and unhealthy, then we were told we couldn’t do that because its not nice, then we’re told to love the body your in and fat is beautiful, now were back to being skinny again cause its healthier.

Black, brown, white, fat, skinny, tall, short, rich, poor, male, female!! We are all the same underneath, we all feel shame, which is beyond ridiculous. But thank god for some of the stronger beautiful successful people who have put themselves out into the light and helped us feel that maybe, just maybe, someone will believe that is was not our fault. Tears fall as I write this and I feel so much respect and love for you beautiful woman. Thank you thank you, let us all remember our humanity. Hold on to your kind hearts ♥️
If you need some more material, I give you a (dr?) Ewa Dąbrowska who is a propagator of &quot;detox&quot; vegetable fast. She claims she can cure anything from cancer, throu thytoid malfunctions to allergies. My mom is going through her fast once or twice a year and she won&#39;t listen to me when I&#39;m saying it does more harm than good... The woman worked at the Gdansk Medical University, she calls herself a doctor, books and articles quote her as if she had a PhD, but at the same time her website says she never had a public dissertation because she found intetest in fasting... The only scientific article I found with her as an author is her unfinished dissertation. Anything else is just bullshit for newspapers. And so freaking many people believe her... How eating 400 kcal a day from vegetables only (no fat, no protein- you are not allowed to eat beans during the fast) can heal your thyroid?
The ugly unknown lady who none has any clue about asks him for a drag look.<br><br>Jeffrey pops ONE single shadow on her (and brown) a tad of glitter and lashes. The end.<br><br>🤦🏻‍♀️<br><br>For real.<br><br>And the lady is annoying af! She cannot shut up!!!
If she has people around her that are overweight or with health issues, it’s a pretty good indicator that it’s a scam
I can guarantee those kids did not run up and ask shit. That woman is tweaked. Also the rest of the world doesn&#39;t have to cater to you fatty!
Je freedom of speech
I’ve seen a video about Fat Camp letting them eat the Foods that made them fat in the first place.
I was able to lose 60 lbs since August and I feel so much better. I ate so horribly and so much. I fed myself on fast food, sugary drinks, and candy, so much candy. I got up to 250lbs.<br><br>My doctor put me on a Ketogenic diet (with lots of cruciferous vegetables and salads), while I also did intermittent fasting and I was able to lose all of that weight. I was able to get off of the heartburn medicine that I was on and I just feel overall so much healthier. Plus being able to fit into thinner clothes was an added benefit as well.<br><br>I did get quite alot of help by using Factor the meal delivery service to order the correct kind of food, but it is way healthier than fast food and is about the same if maybe cheaper than what I was spending on fast food.<br><br>My relationship with sugar and food in general has changed so much. I am no longer being dictated by food and I have so much more time than waiting in lines for fast food.<br><br>I would like to transition to cooking from scratch all of the food that I want to eat, but my current work and living situation makes that difficult, but in the future I am going to work on that as well.<br><br>I also need to build more muscle and lose more fat.
I think it would have made more sense for green goblin to press the button and go back evil, that way it would make everyone question whether his timeliness went back to normal or not in Tobys timeline, plus would make sense as not all bad guys want to be cured. adding to this everyone would have forgotten Peter but he wouldn&#39;t have made the sacrifice but found out when he went to see MJ/doctor strange.
In all fairness the supersize people need a week off from heavy eating
If I have to say one thing it&#39;s that I wish you&#39;d do a better job at clarifying that fat people still deserve to be treated as humans. It&#39;s clear a lot of your comment section do just hate fat people and can&#39;t ride the line between criticism and straight up bullying. I can tell you now I lost the majority of my weight when I had a positive mindset and wanted to take care of my body, not because I hated myself like everyone on the internet wanted me to
Dollar Tree has a great lip plumper that has a subtle tingle, and fills out my lip lines. Love it!
That corn starch will give her a stiff upper lip plus her clothes will be nice and crisp. Lol
Size doesn’t matter No it’s not giving
Why would you give this gross racist a platform.
See when I was expecting my daughter and then after she was born, I never had advice like this and it absolutely destroyed my body. Seriously, I just carried on like the house elf just running around after everybody else, my daughter screanming because she was due a feed and people just ignoring me and pasing her around like a doll, but yeah, people are hideous. I had a really bad infection, my b00bs were agony, I was covered in stretchmarks with a belly hanging down like I don&#39;t even know how to describe it and I was as ill as ill could be. At one point I was so exhausted my milk dried up altogether so I couldn&#39;t even feed my little girl. I never had other mum friends because I couldn&#39;t really go out and no one was welcome to the house I was so completely isolated. It took until well after the breakup 5 years later to start to even physically recover as I&#39;d never been given time to look after myself, so really his receptionist was a godsend.
I love your videos. I had NO idea you lost so much weight. You’re stunning!
I&#39;m honest with myself, so I know that I eat a lot, but then there are times where I dont eat as much. In the end I&#39;m always at a consistent weight however this doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m thin. I&#39;m actually trying to loose weight because my BMI is close to being obese although I don&#39;t look obese. My weight carries very evenly throughout my body, so I look &quot;thinner&quot; than I actually am. I started logging my calories and started being more physical so hopefully I will be at a healthy weight in due time.
For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
I looked at the the lyrics and it&#39;s so disgusting. Being a hoe is not owning your sexuality, it&#39;s giving it away for free to some creep who expected it because he bought you a meal.
Tati! I love this video! You do you!I’m hoping you’ll share how you lost the weight. As someone who is heavier than I’ve ever been, I would love to know your tips on weight loss please🩷 love you and ALL of your videos.
But the problem with strict diet is not eating enough calories, thus veganism can increase the risk of stroke, hair loss, and depression, in this case, it&#39;s better to be only vegetarian, as long as you don&#39;t overeat.
Causing people to lose weight by weaponizing their laziness? That&#39;s genius!
Body positivity mfers make it hard not to hate fat people
They will want that fat back when they are old.
Supersize v superskinny was the best program ever it showed the 2 extreme ends of the spectrum. Often the superskinny actually had a bigger eating disorder than the supersize. still these shows are good motivation for weight loss
Al bundy once said &quot;beautiful women makes us guys want to buy beer, ugly women makes us want to DRINK beer&quot;  and i must now add fake woman makes us want to throw beer. 🤣🤣
It&#39;s not a moral judgment, fat kills, and that&#39;s a fact.
It’s a real shame that this generation of people are so weak and ignorant, that they can’t get up in the morning without coming up with some “poor me” excuses to get some sort of attention.  It is sickening that this world of strong men and women of the past that fought and died for this great country was for the wimps that are just throwing it away for their own benefit.  I feel sorry for my grandchildren that have to be raised in what used to be great.  Now it’s fat people who want attention so they say that they’re  anorexic, or now we are all forced to go along with people, who belong in padded cells, that say they’re a different gender, when clearly they believed they were the correct one their whole lives.  Pedophiles just wanting access and we are allowing it.  It’s disgusting! <br>When is it going to end?  Get some true doctors in that will diagnose these idiots so we can all live in peace once again.  Get our government to step in to protect us from the madness!!!
Jeffree Star aka Skinny Legend: &quot;I&#39;m a food/candy addict&quot;<br><br>Me: looks at gut, does inside
I&#39;m in recovery for a restrictive ED.  Previously diagnosed EDNOS because I wasn&#39;t underweight.  I was in a normal weight range.  Now I would be diagnosed with atypical anorexia.  I don&#39;t like seeing people laughing at Tess due to this revelation.  I agree, I don&#39;t like the phrase &quot;my truth.&quot;  If she&#39;s seeing a mental health professional who diagnosed her with an ED then I don&#39;t see what the problem is.  She doesn&#39;t look like the &quot;typical&quot; anorexic and regardless of the specific diagnosis it is possible for her to have an ED.  EDs can affect anyone, even bigger sized people.  It boggles my mind why it&#39;s okay to make fun of fat people, but it&#39;s not okay to make fun of other groups of people.  I don&#39;t know, call me crazy.  I try my best to extend compassion.
the only possible way to lose weight is to decompose
Wow ashley is thick...everywhere shes not loosing that baby weight yet..shes got a big booty omg!@<br>..
Man shes got a big gut thick all over
People don&#39;t overeat because they don&#39;t know that overeating is bad. They overeat because they are addicted to the comfort of food. People become addicts because of trauma. They will never stop being fat until they learn a better way to deal with trauma.
That was about the size of my first bass 😂
Kiana, this is the first video of yours I saw and I&#39;ve been marathoning your stuff since. You motivated me to buckle up and make healthier choices for myself. I don&#39;t weigh that much, but I&#39;ve not been happy with the weight gain I&#39;ve been having. My brother and I agreed to do this together. He&#39;s got a longer journey ahead, but we&#39;re going to be each other&#39;s cheerleaders and ensure we lose weight, keep it off, and stay fit! Thank you. In just a day you opened my eyes to face reality that we need to make changes NOW.
Respectfully; I disagree with point number 4. Eating every 4-5 hours keeps insulin high, which contributes to weight gain. Dr Jason Fung breaks this down in a lot of his research and I think it would be cool if you did a response to one of his videos. Intermittent fasting has been successful for me, because when you have lower insulin levels you have less hunger.
Am I getting this right? Is this a full series dedicated to an obese person? And it already has 3 seasons?
I only have 3 feet &amp; 9 in of small intestine (which is called Short Gutt Syndrome &amp; requires mass protein to maintain my weight). But there&#39;s a problem...<br>My left kidney was not attached to my body, just laying dormant in my butt cheek till I was 20. So now my right kidney has gone into failure and protein is as bad for the kidneys as caffeine &amp; salt is.<br>So I had to decide should I stay on the high protein &amp; go on dialysis next year or should I slowly starve to death?<br>My weight hovers between 98 and 101 lbs and I don&#39;t have alot of energy. I DO Eat alot of peanut butter (2 Tsp a day) cause hey, I gotta have SOME protein.<br>But I exist mostly on fruits &amp; grains. And I can honestly say, after not eating meat for awhile, if I put meat in my mouth, it literally makes me gag.<br>Sorry for the tangent I was just trying to stress how hard it can be when ya have specific dietary needs
yeah ive been overweight my entire life (same with like the majority of my family) and I could never have watched this because i have major issues with depictions of addictions and eating disorders (plus that opening scene where the MC jerks off and has a heart attack wasnt exactly my cup of tea) so im glad this vid talks about it cause this actually made it way more accessible!  also if you want to reaserch &quot;big food&quot; and how food companies exploit people you should throw some reserch into health accessibility in food which is basically how healthy food/meals can&#39;t be consistently prepared by working-class people/familys while food thats almost by design going to make people fat is cheep and usually pre-made which results in health and weight loss being inaccessible for certain classes (which leaves diet companys open to sell them &quot;cheap pre-made diet supplements!&quot; that usually aren&#39;t even healthy or don&#39;t actually work *cough Slimfast cough*).  Sorry this turned into a rant but idk, felt fitting lol.  great video!
You say Dylan plays into harmful stereotypes. and then seconds later, you say being a real man is about thick beards and fast cars 😂 I like u Brett but cmon girl.
freddy was doing the most to keep her fat even like taking the fall for her on lies<br>you think he might have a feeder fetish?
have you seen virgin mountain? it doesnt focus on the fat issue a lot but i really liked the movie
Get this, these entitled parents got mad when these kids took up pogo and lost weight
Honestly, scientific data is not even necessary to understand the negative consequences of obesity. Just take a look at our surroundings! My friends and family members who are overweight experience various medical issues, and their overall quality of life is compromised. While individuals who are overweight might still maintain a certain level of healthiness before the age of 30, once they surpass that milestone, a multitude of symptoms begin to manifest. It&#39;s important to note that I am referring to overweight individuals, not even addressing obesity.<br><br>Please don&#39;t misunderstand me. I spent 50% of my life being overweight with being 50% overweight and I am well aware of the profound negative impact it can have on a person.
Former binge eater myself, I beat this disease almost a decade ago and became a competitive cyclist. I came across your channel by accident a few days ago, and, Kiana, I can’t stop watching! Holy shit I had no idea I needed this type of content! I had no clue mukbang or fat activism even existed to this extent. I’m well aware of all the science you’re highlighting throughout your videos, but the delivery is so entertaining, I watched almost every video. Keep it up 👏
they really think if you don&#39;t blindly agree with them on everything then that means you hate fat people. jfc make it make sense.
there is NO POINT in doing all that under makeup and then covering w that thick ass foundation wtf
No judgement, but when she says, &quot;a meal&quot; - she may be talking about two pizzas and a burrito.  The fact is to maintain this weight requires 5-6k calories a day.
Weight loss is really tough. I get discouraged that ill never get past this plateau after doing well. Amy is inspiring for me. Im just trying to keep 50lbs off and its near impossible!!
&quot;low calorie don&#39;t mean no calorie&quot; definitely words to live by when trying to lose weight. I know I&#39;ve tricked myself into eating more then I should because it was low calorie, but because of the amount it became a high calorie snack
This is why I eat carnivore.  High fat, high protein, little to no carbs
Facts: Calories doesn&#39;t cause fat development. It&#39;s strictly Carbohydrates. When I discovered this, I stopped eating carbs all together. I switched to only eating meat, eggs, and a little bit of cheese. I lost 40 pounds in 3 months and maintained all my muscle without any exercise. It&#39;s nuts. My man boobs completely vanished. Vegan and vegetarian did not work. Dr Berry is a great physician that you should watch. That being said, these people could very well be telling the truth in regards to not eating that much. They might just being eating way too much carbs.
I honestly love Amy, she is a wonderful person, strong and has an amazing attitude. She tried so hard to get to her goal, a healthier weight, have a child, and she achieved them. I hope that Gage (Gauge?) understands when he is older how much his mother fought and went through to have him. Not to lord over him, but to hope he understands just how much his lovely mother wanted him.
Tati and Scott PLEASE PLEASE do more videos together!! I learned so many tricks and tips from you Scott and seeing it through Tati&#39;s perspective. It&#39;s amazing to see what we can do to get the best makeup that works for our face!  I usually just go with my usual makeup and don&#39;t have a lot of insights on so many more things I can do. PLUS you guys have great working chemistry and sense of humor, which makes it so entertaining &amp; never boring to keep watching TIL THE END! Just bought your stuff, Scott and I can&#39;t wait to try them on!! Thanks both!
I worked at chick fil a and I ate their food during breaks for the year and half I was there. The food got old after a while and I gained weight. On the bright side it has given me a motivation to hit the gym again and loose fat and gain muscle instead but at the same time it’s difficult to get rid of the belly fat I’ve produced by all that chick fil a.
Seed oils and sugar just avoid those two things. just binge steak and you won&#39;t be obese
I have a super slow and sluggish metabolism due to having an Atomic cocktail  (Radioactive Iodine) when I was 24 and being on Thyroxine for so many years, I&#39;m now 68 and gain weight incredibly quickly, I&#39;ve learned to have a three-day fast, drinking water only, about 3 times a month, most often I eat one to two high protein meal a day, no carbs, and once a week I have a high good fat extra large salad, with either olive oil, avocado oil, and sheep&#39;s milk cheese with braggs vinegar, that is my only raw veggies for the week, and I may have cooked non starchy vegetables once a week as well, other than that I only eat beef,  un - farmed salmon steaks, and pasture raised eggs, decaf coffee with  heavy cream and sweetened with burch xylitol, also some frozen wild blueberries a couple times a week... This has been a very effective approach for a steady and slow weight loss for me, I also love mall walking and climbing up very high hills  4 times a week, I&#39;ve learned as well that at my age a one to two hour nap especially after being active is necessary daily...It&#39;s been such a startling realization to me to learn how truly little food I need to  thrive in life.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=548FCRTVBys&amp;t=12m35s">12:35</a> Amazing video up until this part.  You are absolutely at fault for any addiction you might have.  Just because there are unhealthy things out there that are meant to addict you does not mean you are not at fault.  If you are an adult and are fat, you need to acknowledge that you are 100% at fault for being fat.  No one forces you to eat that way.
I think that the better way to put this is : “You’ve got to want to research for a way to make weight loss easier.” I feel that because I found that Ketogenic eating was that ‘easy way out’ because being in ketosis devastates my cravings for junk foods that this is an easier way to work out cravings for carbs. I think that this should be a part of weight loss theory.
I feel really seen by this channel. I&#39;ve lost weight several times only to relapse into binging and put the weight back on, even when I was happy with my body. The only time I was at a consistently healthy weight was when I was homeless and walking several hours each day to get from couch to couch. Unfortunately that destroyed my physical health (it was the final straw for my developing rheumatoid arthritis to flare in full force) and it&#39;s been very painful to live let alone exercise since, so I&#39;m back in a hole.<br>I think I&#39;m going to be ready soon to try tackling my binge eating again. I have things to look forward to in my life, and I want them to be in a body and brain I can be proud of.
Who is that Ben guy? He walked into being schooled on so many things. Limited views and struggled to answer without his bias. Tyson put him in his place. Freedom for all, or you have an agenda to rule over others and disregard their constitutional rights is what I think I heard.
I totally agreed! Scott Barnes is unique and his professionalism and talent have build his own empire as his own name. He doesn’t have a shadow of someone else to shine. I honestly say this, Scott you are unique and the best Makeup Artist ever. God bless you!!
Loved the movie so much. But the Strange stuff, in the beginning, was off like Shapiro says. What gets me is that in Endgame, the Ancient One says that Dr. Strange was supposed to be &quot;the best of us&quot; referring to sorcerer supremes throughout history. At the beginning here, Strange who is supposed to be the adult acts like the stereotypical irresponsible reckless teenager misusing freedom, strength, responsibility, etc more than spiderman does. This is especially true when you consider Wong&#39;s warnings. That does fit his personality though. But it was a great movie. Top 5 Marvel movies for me.
I am on the 8th day of my water fast and I went from overweight* to a normal bmi- lost 16 lbs.<br><br> I&#39;ve gotten 4x as many smiles, way more stares, &quot;have a good days&quot; from strangers... makes me feel like maybe I am also biased towards overweight people.
I&#39;m actually really happy I found you, after my grandfathers passing my father hasn&#39;t been the same. My dad constantly eats chips, McDonalds, basically whatever food he can get his hands on he&#39;ll eat. We used to order a lot from UberEATS but quit because we couldn&#39;t afford it. My family learned my father had applied and received a credit card and maxed it out within the month, every day my dad would order over $200 of food, eat it in secret and throw away the trash in a neighbors garbage. We caught him when the letter in the mail for his credit card came and since my mother does all the billing she was shocked. He broke down emotionally, threatened to take my life because I wouldn&#39;t share my food, and has broken down and cried multiple times.<br><br>I started watching your videos on our TV and it finally got my father interested in watching. No progress has been made YET! I&#39;m hopeful my dad will watch and will get help. From time to time I hear your videos play on our TV. It breaks my heart to see my dad this way and I hope he gets better.<br><br>Dad if your reading this I love you, I miss him too.
Does anyone know what kind of dog Puka is? He is the cutest thing and perfect size.
What if you got rapped ... And suddenly you find your self backing a cake you never wanted? What if the perfect father figure dude you picked and dated suddenly vanishes when you got pregnant? What if you find out the perfect birthday cake you are carrying in the belly isn&#39;t going to be so perfect, and will newer be able to walk, talk, backe even a toast, not to mention a cake? What then? There are manny what if&#39;s. It is a bad choice I agree, but better than none. Please stop pretending we&#39;re living in a perfect world.
This has opened up my eyes I really needed to hear this thx for the video and I have been experiencing with my own issues at stake because of how I keep struggling with how other people keep telling me to lose weight
Tess &amp; FA&#39;s: &quot;All are welcome here. We want everyone to feel beautiful and they should be beautiful in the skin they&#39;re in. Anyone can be with us.&quot;<br>Not-so-plus-sized to skinny folks: &quot;Can we join in?&quot;<br>Tess/FA&#39;s: &quot;No! Stop trying to change us!&quot;
It is as easy as eat less though; I used to be 100 lbs overweight and now I’m 50 lbs overweight and I lost that 50 lbs by eating less, I don’t exercise and haven’t even changed what I eat, I just eat a third of what I used to eat… I literally just eat less… and it works.
I personally know three people that’s had this surgery, sadly after a few years all three gained the weight back.
Its not an addiction to potatoes..........its an addition to the CARBS and SUGAR in and from the potatoes.  This woman is addicted to carbs and sugar, like so many other people in the USA!<br>When &quot;food fats&quot; were listed as &quot;bad&quot;.....food companies replaced them with sugar.  Which is why you see packages of cookies
There may be as many &quot;obese&quot; people in the UK as the US - but obese starts at 90kg (about 200LBS) for a 5&#39;9&quot; man, barely even noticeable, and there&#39;s no upper limit.. there aren&#39;t many people in mobility scooters or needing cranes to be lifted out of bed.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s shocking for British people.
Brussels sprouts; why would she start off with the most disgusting vegetable to eat… She should’ve eaten a lightly, steamed carrot, or some peas
Like...like...i&#39;m all for plus sized women as long as like...like  not mentioning me!
Just leave that massive fat mountain behind somewhere.. I don’t think that massive thing will be missed by anyone, do you?
She should call it weight journey and remove the word loss
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgflKjfarcw&amp;t=7m11s">7:11</a> I don’t hate on mini products because for me it’s less wasteful since I can almost never get through a full size product before it expires.
😂 and they say American&#39;s are fat
Doesn&#39;t really work though. Just because an oven is automated doesn&#39;t mean it just does its thing completely free. Think of all the energy an oven takes to run, or even better - imagine if it was a wood-fired oven and you had to put twigs in every 3.5 seconds (which is what 3 meals a day for a full pregnancy would be compared to running a oven for 50 minutes). Not really just something that happens &quot;if you just leave it&quot;.
It’s very weird to tell someone if they lose weight they are erasing their fat body. I am not my fat body or my fit body or thin body. I exist in a body that I want to keep existing in for a long time, and I want my existence to be as enjoyable as possible which includes intentional weight loss. I’m doing positive things for my body and myself. How is that not body positivity
The only thing that&#39;s worked for me is doing keto. I don&#39;t have the desire to binge eat at all. My portion sizes, even when I have free reign on a &quot;cheat meal,&quot; are significantly smaller than what they once were. I don&#39;t have any cravings for the junk food that people binge on - chips, candy, chocolate, donuts, pizza, etc. - and no one really wants to binge on low carb foods like eggs. Junk food creates a chemical high in your brain.
Dude I’ve seen a video getting the response from woman to equal pay saying that (responsibility to a job and equality for checks have nothing to do with each other what matters is my equal pay)there just no getting through a thick headed skull doesn’t even matter about trying to go around it they still end up complaining about not having the same check from 2 different jobs that require different skills and and experience
As someone who&#39;s chubby, i&#39;m trying to be as skinny as a anime girl. Wish me luck yall
I&#39;m know this is a 3 year old video, but boy does it ever hit me hard. I&#39;m trying to keep to 1200 calories per day, and feel so guilty when I don&#39;t, and relieved when I do. I check all labels for calories and sugar and it just consumes my life to lose weight. I&#39;m an emotional eater too.
Lol its true though. Kylie expects everyone to kiss her ass. She always trys to be better then kid why do you think she got all that work done and redid herself to the point she looks like a different person. Kim is more business oriented. Kim always takes criticism because she&#39;s used to it she always gets criticized. I tried Kylie&#39;s stuff a while ago and her stuff was disgusting and her brushes were fuzzy and nasty. I would think Kim is more sophisticated over Kylie anyway. And I love and respect how Jeffree is so real and honest and whether he likes someone or not he&#39;s always honest about a review on a product Because most people will just hate on someone and just say their stuff is crap or their pays to just say they like it. and let&#39;s be real Jeffries formulas way better than both of them
If you need some more material, I give you a (dr?) Ewa Dąbrowska who is a propagator of &quot;detox&quot; vegetable fast. She claims she can cure anything from cancer, throu thytoid malfunctions to allergies. My mom is going through her fast once or twice a year and she won&#39;t listen to me when I&#39;m saying it does more harm than good... The woman worked at the Gdansk Medical University, she calls herself a doctor, books and articles quote her as if she had a PhD, but at the same time her website says she never had a public dissertation because she found intetest in fasting... The only scientific article I found with her as an author is her unfinished dissertation. Anything else is just bullshit for newspapers. And so freaking many people believe her... How eating 400 kcal a day from vegetables only (no fat, no protein- you are not allowed to eat beans during the fast) can heal your thyroid?
I started counting my calories and manage to drop 85 pounds in 6-8 months I need to drop another 60 to be out of the obese catagory
I love your videos. I had NO idea you lost so much weight. You’re stunning!
I have super thick brows. I don’t do much (or anything) on the daily but for full glam, a bit of pencil and something to add hold, so about 5 minutes? Also I have a stupendous brow lady and she keeps be legit.
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
I&#39;d say I&#39;m liberally republican. I believe in the Republican values, but I also share some sentiments with true liberals (to clarify, non-radical). <br><br>We need a strong basis for the country, but there does need to be some change in the system about the little things to appease the people such as legalizing weed and giving back rights to certain freedoms we have been restrained from, such as the &quot;fighting words&quot; basis.
when i heard the whole tess thing kinda made me realize. why is it a thing now that when a girl/woman looks like they are at a normal weight ppl start acting like they got an eating disorder or are starving themselves. is it weird now to be at a normal weight?
The only tattoo I&#39;ll ever get is the tattoo my father got of a traditional Lithuanian crusader to represent our Lithuanian heritage
I can honestly say I was not a fan of Tammy. It was always an attitude, always excuses, she just didn’t want to change her ways. I have no sympathy for people who can’t put down that box of mallowmars even though they know it’s killing them. The fact that she had a wake up call and is now working towards a goal is promising. I hope she succeeds, gets the weight off and keeps it off without relapsing. Time will tell. I have no expectations, but I’m hoping she keeps up with it.
I liked a&amp;f from 2007 and on. I always felt special wearing the clothes because it felt fancy. Then after making enough to easily afford their merch, I saw what liberals and fat people did to the brand and I have more disgust than I ever could have for them targeting attractive people.<br>Looking at their social media these days, I&#39;ll never touch their merchandise again.
Time and time again its said the cheapest foods are the processed /takeaway /fast food and this is the biggest lie and yet another way to avoid taking responsibility. That first women that was letting her childs teeth rot is a child abuser, she thought it amusing, a vile person. And the obese couple trying to force their child to have surgery, what evil parents and more abusive, just absolutely sickening. obese children are abused children and the parents are 100% responsible
Im a nurse, 90% of my patients this size are completely immobile. Trapped in bed, unable to even turn back and forth in bed when someone changes their diaper. We use essentially metal cranes in order to lift them. So for people to say this is a derogatory depiction, most people of this size could not even open the door to grab that pizza. Like get a grip on yourself before publicly reviewing something with such a skewed outlook
Not true for everyone. If it’s always restriction that prompts bingeing nobody would have ever got fat thru binge eating in the first place.
Honestly there are not so fat people in britain at all by a long shot. I never saw a really huge obese person in california but i saw really enormous people and i had never in my life seen such peopke in the uk. There are some obese peopke and some fat people for sure but i never saw anything like what i saw in california it was amazing and mind blowing ...i had to try not to stare but my eyes would just be drawn and my jaw would just drop completely because i had never seen anything like it. And i believe california isnt as bad as other usa
The science of snacking is nice and all, but I have a feeling those employees also gained weight due to stress 😅
So, I’ll be banging this out tomorrow for Core Day! I love your videos; your humour is refreshing and I’m it’s so good to see a curvy lady (plus bump!) looking so strong and confident! It’s infectious! Thank you for the new ideas, the body positivity and the booty!!
I had to lose over 100lbs.  When I did I still struggled with self image.  As far as I was concerned, since I spent most of my life being fat, I would always be.  My therapist said &quot;You have fat head&quot;.  My mind refused to accept what my body looked like. I still have work to do but I&#39;m slowly starting to shake the fat head off my shoulders.
Totally makes sense, this was before all the greedy corporations took a hold on our food supply and before global organizations could monitor everything.<br>Amazing video, very well presented!
Disney is not the same as the Disney I grew up with ,it&#39;s turned ugly😞
I felt so sorry for the teenage kitchen hand, Katie. Being treated like that by an employer, especially at that age, can have a devastating effect on your self confidence. And when she applies for another job, she will have to produce a reference from that employer. I&#39;ve worked for people like that, including in the food industry (Bakkavor, who produce patries, tarts and crumbles for Sainsburys, Tesco, Waitrose), being shouted at and called stupid (I don&#39;t speak the language from Goa) and a slut (because I am single and do not live with my parents - most of the staff are 1st generation Indian immigrants, and although they are Roman Catholics, they are really not westernised) all night long was really distressing. I actually made nightmares (or daymares, as I worked night shifts, and so slept during the day) about work. On top of it I was on a 0-hour contract so they litterally called me when they needed someone, with never more than 10 hours&#39; notice before the start of my shift, and sometimes less than 2 hours... and about one third of my shifts were cancelled, sometimes as little as half an hour before I was due to start. Over the 6 months period I earned less than half the minimum salary and if I told them I was not available for a shift (because I needed to go to the laundromat) I was &#39;punished&#39; by not being given any shifts for the coming nights, and once for 2 weeks on end. Eventually I insisted on using my holiday allowance in order to have an eye test (can&#39;t really have one between 2 12-hour night shifts, and as the shifts were confirmed on a day to day basis, I could not make any plans for the daytime as I needed to sleep AND answer the phone in case they offered me a shift) I was not given any shifts for 6 weeks... then was told I was fired! The way they treat staff in the food industry is disgusting, and I will never buy pastries or tarts from Waitrose, Sainsburys or Tesco in the future. As if this were not enough, the plant was not very hygienic: people were reluctant to wash their hands, including after using the toilets, and if products fell on the floor, it would sometimes be picked up and be put back up on the production line... Anyone who is immuno depressed, please make your own baked goods, do not buy any from supermarkets.
Does the baby has any health risks while developing in such fat woman?
I listen to podcast originally and was inspired to see if there was a video and here I am 😘. I just have to say I was touched by the transparency of Jada’s mom when she said “ what you really are is a judgmental bitch”. That statement was a key a opportunity for freedom.  I do not think I have ever witnessed this the ability to not have fear of judgment.  The bondage of judgement is a double edged sword it goes both ways.  Great shot thanks for the wow moment
Am I the only one that have noticed that when you have someone this bes, the family members are almost always obese as well. The exception seems to to be a thin guy that wants a fat wife. This is also true in my 600 lb pound life. These people should also stand on the scale and think about how they got where they are.
I honestly don&#39;t see the issue. You don&#39;t want to sell sizes larger than L. Fine. Good for you thinking you can survive by excluding half of the population right off the bat.<br>Or what they&#39;ll start making 2XL and I&#39;ll suddenly buy their clothes. Seriously?
You looked good with that &quot;baby fat&quot; Ben!
Its so hard to not overeat 😅
It&#39;s not the fat, it&#39;s the sugar and white flour.
Jokes on all you guys and your jokes about how massive that I am, I am on the verge of compressing into a singularity, then you will be the fat one!
I am 46kg. I NEED THIS JOB TO GAIN WEIGHT!!!
I&#39;m a fitness guy and I&#39;ll say it. I&#39;m fat phobic. I&#39;m scared to death of being fat.
You girls need to talk? It seems only women don&#39;t no most womens&#39; boobs are noticeably not the same size.
I really hope this interview and other interviews of similar experiences will make the proper changes it needs for the fashion community and the model community. Very disheartening to hear that is how people of any size, colour, culture are treated. Thank you Ashley for shining a light on where it matters most ❤️
Mental illness is the root cause of over eating, and never mentioned in videos like this. There is nothing physically you can do to help these poor souls to regain their healthy shape and not go back to it even after loosing dramatic amount of weight. You have to understand your purpose in life and start looking for the truth, You will find it one day if you put all the bias and media brain washing aside.
Easy tip for weight loss.<br>Become fat adapted and learn about fat fasting.<br>Fat reduces hunger and cravings meanwhile sweets and carbs increase hunger and cravings. <br><br>You&#39;re all welcome
The things i have heard from pediatricians, would make you cry. Parents never once giving their child water or juice to drink. Instead it is Soda, chocolate milk, sweet tea, coffee etc. &quot;He just loves mcdonalds nuggets&quot; &quot;He is so big and strong for his age&quot;...No lady he is fat, cause you are feeding him garbage.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
I think it’s more the mental side of undiagnosed and untreated hypothyroidism, the thyroid causes many problems and also people store fat. It’s the same as some who constantly eat junk food and don’t put weight on, it can be hyperthyroidism.
Maybe Marie has an e.d? they often times want to be healthy but take it to an extreme and lose the fact that fat, sugar and fast carbohydrates doesn&#39;t break a healthy diet and can and should be apart of it. Don&#39;t focus on taking away &quot;unhealthy food&quot; focus on adding healthy food and don&#39;t demonize anything. Balance is key to longevity
freddy was doing the most to keep her fat even like taking the fall for her on lies<br>you think he might have a feeder fetish?
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
when i heard about how she was acting, i imagined her being really ugly to reflect the inside, but she&#39;s deceptively pretty
How is it that its always the ugly people complaining lol
It’s just a chance for some of the really obese to continue to be bullies.
I don&#39;t understand that Body Positivity is only for obese people for the reason that they had struggle to lose weight but wasn&#39;t treated the same way for malnourished thin child from poor countries struggle to gain weight due to lack of food. Yes, thin and fat are opposite but the situation are just the same to qualify both for Body Positivity.
Tammy has done nothing but gain weight over the course of the show and it showed through her sheer laziness, narcissism and absolute lack of self awareness. Shit her body has literally gone to the final resort of storing excess fat in her forehead of all places. <br><br>Amy on the other hand along with her and Tammy&#39;s brother put everything aside to go through with their journeys and complete them and they took full responsibility when thr screwed up.
Saying that you used to be fat and acting like that&#39;s why you can&#39;t hate fat people is like saying you have a black friend after being called out for racism.<br><br>I don&#39;t know that you hate fat people, this is just a weird defense.
I have all fat phobic chairs.
You luck freaken ugly
fat fuck: being fat is hard :( i can&#39;t move, i have diabetes, i can&#39;t walk T_T its so haaaaaard....*cries*<br>also the fat fuck: THE 60 BOXES OF PIZZAS IS NOT ENOUGH I NEED MORE FOOD!
This country shows how people are HIGHLY effected by the people they have around. If everyone is obese, people are more prone to become obese, if everyone is lazy, people are more prone to become lazy, etc.<br><br>AND REMEMBER!!!! The more unhealthy you are, the easier the government can control you and enslave you!
The COVID pandemic should be all the proof you need. An overwhelming majority of COVID related deaths were.. Obese people, or at the minimum overweight. And people will try to spin it like &quot;oh well they already had underlying conditions that COVID just amplified..&quot; yes, underlying conditions caused by being obese in the first place. It&#39;s a disease that the body constantly tries to fight and thus we have type II diabetes and high blood pressure and all sorts of other things.
It might be more useful to discuss the hormonal and bilogical components of weight gain. The focus on obesity, is a focus on the aesthetic. If health is what you care about, discuss health. There is a subtle but important distinction. As a person who was fat and lost weight... people gave no fucks about my health when i was fat and when i lost weight. I simple became easier on the eyes and that&#39;s all that mattered. Also, your thumbnails of excessively obese people can read as dehumanization and a caricature of a community you are trying to help. Just think maybe about if yourtarget audience, leaves your channel feeling shamed or empowered. (not to say they don&#39;t) great well researched content! I&#39;d love to even see some content about insulin resistance, pcos, etc etc etc since many of those factors affect &quot;obesity&quot;. The other part of this is.... i recommend some class analysis, race analysis even. Making obesity an individual and behavioral issue... screams that perhaps, you could be missing something important.
My grandmother died of complications of long term out of control diabetes. She was morbidly obese for years.<br>The last time I saw her she had both legs amputated to the hips.  She died the next day.<br>Talk about motivation.
This video takes any agency away from locals at all. Almost as if these people are force fed by some nefarious “westerner”. You like fatty meat? Oh it must be that the west dumped them on you. You want a car? Oh don’t fall for ‘western’ propaganda about cars being more convenient than walking.
Sorry, but gaining body fat is not a scientific question as much as it is an evolutionary question...
Am I getting this right? Is this a full series dedicated to an obese person? And it already has 3 seasons?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFHqiHQgF8&amp;t=3m47s">3:47</a> it means that having 0/ body fat is not healthy BUT HAVING 500 POUNS OF FAT ITS NOT HEALTY EATHER
I loved it. and if you think the movie was about making fun of a fat man, you clearly missed the point. You probably never have wathed a Darren Aaronovsky film before. The move wasnt about a fat guy, but his redemption. Its a redemption story.
as a former fat person, it doesnt seem at all that you don&#39;t hate fat people. Fat people hate fat people and you just make them come out of their cognitive dissonance.
Even fat people don’t like fat people 😂
I was about to comment that I&#39;ve never felt insecure about my appearance, even though I&#39;m not exactly a D-cup model with long flowing hair xD But then I remembered the first time I went to Paris and how me and my sister felt like absolute trolls. Sure, we&#39;re skinny, but being Dutch, we felt so tall and unelegant compared to all the petite girls with thick, dark hair and mysterious dark eyes there. Somehow, everyone we saw in Paris who was our age, was ridiculously attractive looking. So yeah, I don&#39;t get insecure easily, but when surrounded by people who are all more elegant than I am... I totally get the feeling.
And still the super skinny one&#39;s look better than the big one&#39;s :/
Mental Hospitals need to happen, very large.  CA needs the most.  Plus, they have 5150 already.  This father is at the top of the list.
Mustard greens help you lose stomach fat and helps your Core !
I remember going to a music festival a few years ago in Rimini, near Bologna Italy. I loved the beaches but I know a lot of Italian&#39;s say the beaches there suck 🤣<br><br>There were no McDonald&#39;s or fast food places within several miles. Nearly EVERYONE was in great shape, it completely put me to shame. I saw like 2 overweight people (1 of them sadly being myself,) there over the 3-4 days I visited, I couldn&#39;t believe it. Everyone was either lean or near jacked. Then came back to my home city in the north of the UK and it was business as usual, about 50% of people obese.....
For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
Wth is &quot;supersize&quot; lol. Almost as if they are trying to cover up or feel good about being obese AF.
Sexy fat breast
The food industry has NOTHING to do with children being obese. Healthy food options are out there. Obese children are a direct result of lazy parents. Period.
I was chubby as a child, imagine going to fat camp, and then realized, &quot;bruh i can literally lose weight myself&quot;
lolol girl shows a picture of when she is a little bit chubby and says she knows how it is to be fat.. laaaawl.. wtf
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnZS3EbMHc&amp;t=4m19s">4:19</a> is being skinny and beautiful everything you hoped it would be? Serious question, though I assume you garner more self worth from the positive changes you&#39;ve managed to make, more than from staring into the mirror.<br><br>You&#39;re a big (small) inspiration to a lot of us.
I think there&#39;s always some truth to obese people claims they don&#39;t eat as much. Some do eat as much as a lot of smaller sized people do. It really has a lot to do with personal differences in metabolism and physiology, many of which we could not fathom to understand.
Many of the problems humans have are because society have developed faster than the human brain. The human brain looks for food. It used to be hard to get food.. therefore no overeating. Nowadays we have an abundance of food at our fingertips, all the time. So the human brain thinks &quot;must eat and store fat for the time there&#39;s a lack of food&quot;. Our brains haven&#39;t developed fast enough.
The focus should be education and physical experience not the scale. <br><br>Many obese children and adults do not know WHAT physical exertion is supposed to feel like and these kids should be learning how fun it can be
Thick NVM fat or pregnant
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TzmIPscuY&amp;t=18m26s">18:26</a> recently I have been putting a huge focus in my diet on nutrition and I have seen so many improvements in my health. I just feel good. I am putting veggies in every meal. I switched over to cheaper fattier cuts of meat to save money but eat less and I swear I have way more energy. I use real butter in everything and I have so much less brain fog.
I think this is why my sister is a sort out individual because my fater never stopped hugging his little girl. I am her big brother cant be more proud of that girl, she is the smartest girl i met. She studies a lot and mind her own business.
1 minute in and I already need a flow chart to explain everything with this<br><br>Hong Kong- better known as land the British stole from China<br><br>Taliban- We gave their forefathers weapons and enabled them<br><br>Ukraine- Even NATO itself admits they provoked Russia<br><br>Taiwan- One China Policy, Americ doesn’t recognize Taiwan, nor does the rest of the world
It almost seems with fat positivity, that weve arrived in a world were you can deliberatly buy breath mints that make your breath stink of shit, on purpose, and a lot of them look as though they dont need them...
As a large girl…ok, fat…I never feel people are being “fat-phobic” when they discuss eating healthy. I eat healthy and I eat very little. Literally as a teen and into my twenties I was anorexic and destroyed my metabolism; super hard to lose weight in my 50s now with all the menny hormones…people need to chill the eff out with all the phobias.
Now, it is utterly BOLLOCKS to claim that obesity is caused by poverty that in turn leads to a lack of money to buy nutritious food.<br><br>If you are poor, you will not even have access to junk food.<br><br>In the more intelligent East where I come from, obesity is known as a rich person&#39;s plight. We have a euphemism here to describe an overweight person. We would often say in jest, &#39;Wow. Long time no see. You look prosperous now.&#39;<br><br>Most baby boomers and their parents, the interwar generation, were never overweight. Many were skinny or even ripped, to use today&#39;s adjective.<br><br>My paternal grandparents were a tad better off than my maternal grandparents. And you can tell by their physicality. My paternal grandfather went to the elite schools. He became a watercolour artist and a pioneer in my country for drawing the nude female form. Even his vocation was bourgeois. He was not fat but on the plump side.<br><br>My mother&#39;s father had formal schooling up to only nine or ten years old. He was a street food hawker. And he was scrawny.<br><br>Hmm. The bourgeois grandfather lived to 73. The scrawny grandfather? 96. And he started to have dementia only after 90.
Fat phobia? It is about health. Making excuses for people who are overweight does not help them. Why someone is overweight has a lot of different issues like people. They don&#39;t need activists, they need assistance.
&quot;You ARE erasing a potentially fat body.&quot; GOOD!!! 😂 HOW is me going from 200 to 122 a HORRIBLE and non-&quot;positive&quot; thing?! 😱 My step brother died of obesity this spring, not making it to 50. I have smoked half pack for 28 years and out-lived him.
They like everyone except non-fat people
I should eat only green so you can be healthy and &quot;SKINNY&quot; 💚🍏😝
adhd, binge eater here!!! my biggest help has been MEAL PREPPING and SWAPPING things that have sugar that i can eat sugar free, and NOT BUYING the foods, since for me out of sight, out of mind helps a little :).<br>so things like mayo, ranch, jelly, peanut butter, bread, ice cream, get them low sodium, sugar and fat free. <br>food like that doenst need extra sugar or fats, and you dont need the extra sugar or carbs.<br>my current binge struggle is now in 2023, fastfood is easier to get with  a push of a button :))))))))
How about all those fat old people… Oh yeah, there aren’t any.
When you’re in an environment where the person doesn’t want to change and you’re in the mindset of where you want to change, it’s frustrating. I’ve cut out a lot of sugar, soda, sweets and I calorie count and I exercise more and more and I’ve lost almost 10 pound already. My mom is okay at eating healthy and changing but she’s a picky eater. The problem is my father, diagnosed with diabetes, kidney issues, hernia problems and cause of not doing physical therapy after being in the hospital for so long. I find mini cans of soda, white bread, more fat less lean meat, some fruit but not a lot and vegetables, covered in cheese. It’s frustrating for me trying to kick sugar addiction, plus my boyfriend is the pickiest eater I’ve ever met in my life. Ugh it’s tough but I feel great and look great
The thumbnail model was obsessed with her photo-editor to thin her photos and remove ugly features, like flabs and etc.
I think it&#39;s clear that with 73.4% of us being OVERWEIGHT or OBESE, more people couldn&#39;t CARE LESS about even looking DECENT much less being actively beautiful.  People aren&#39;t EVEN TRYING!
People don&#39;t overeat because they don&#39;t know that overeating is bad. They overeat because they are addicted to the comfort of food. People become addicts because of trauma. They will never stop being fat until they learn a better way to deal with trauma.
Refined carbs do that more than &quot;fat &quot;
if it was only potatoes, it would be healthy and she would not be fat.<br>the problem is cheese. we are starch burners!

Its not an addiction to potatoes..........its an addition to the CARBS and SUGAR in and from the potatoes.  This woman is addicted to carbs and sugar, like so many other people in the USA!<br>When &quot;food fats&quot; were listed as &quot;bad&quot;.....food companies replaced them with sugar.  Which is why you see packages of cookies

OMG yes it was totally my dream to go to fat camp as a child as well! I wasn&#39;t even particularly fat, just demonstrably not the skinny child my parents wanted me to be.
McDonald’s was the first to create the addiction scam. Parents today should know the dangers. Usually fat adults create fat children🥲
I’m fatphobic about my own body but don’t give a shit about others. I’ve had chronic hip pain for 8 years. It’s only gotten better this year after I lost 23 kilo. I’m terrified of getting bigger again because I don’t wanna be in pain like that again
The parents..at time they themselves are fat and obese..
The presenter himself used to be obese and so was his family. He went through a lot of abuse and worked hard to be fit and healthy.
Former binge eater myself, I beat this disease almost a decade ago and became a competitive cyclist. I came across your channel by accident a few days ago, and, Kiana, I can’t stop watching! Holy shit I had no idea I needed this type of content! I had no clue mukbang or fat activism even existed to this extent. I’m well aware of all the science you’re highlighting throughout your videos, but the delivery is so entertaining, I watched almost every video. Keep it up 👏
Jokes on all you guys and your jokes about how massive that I am, I am on the verge of compressing into a singularity, then you will be the fat one!
fat people want the positive feedback skinny and attractive people get but dont want to put in the work to get skinny and more attractive
Imagine being so fat your body has to store it in your forehead...
This movie: Portrays the struggles of an obese man in his every day life.<br>Fat positivity: <b>*in a whinny voice*</b> But why would you show it that way???? Waaaaahhhh!<br><br>Because is reality, you cry baby.
Idk if anyone else has had an experience like this, but even when I wasn&#39;t attempting to lose weight, I would binge - and we&#39;re talking stretches of time like weeks or months on end of 3000+ calories a day - but in my case, I was maintaining my healthy weight, not gaining. Now, I do run quite a lot, but the missing puzzle piece is actually the type of food I&#39;m prone to binging on: pretty much always nuts and nut butters, so otherwise healthy whole foods that were extremely high in fat. I found out through an ultrasound for something else that I had a massive gallstone, which would explain both the types of foods binged on and the lack of weight gain. I&#39;m hesitant to get my gallbladder taken out because doctors keep telling me I&#39;m likely to still have many of the same digestive problems afterwards. So that&#39;s where I&#39;m at. But in case there&#39;s someone watching this who is frustrated because their binge eating doesn&#39;t fit this pattern, like mine didn&#39;t, and they don&#39;t know what to do, I just want them to know there can be medical reasons that you&#39;re binging, so do talk to a doctor. You&#39;re also at higher risk of gallstones if you&#39;re overweight or have lost a lot of weight. Neither applied to me, so it was just sheer luck that I was ever diagnosed.
This video has really driven home just how selfish and manipulative self-created victims truly are. Tammy is basically my ex-mother - she was so vile that I disowned her decades ago. But while I lived with her, I saw many of the traits Tammy displays. With my ex-mother, I called it her martyr role - she was constantly complaining, whining, and inviting people to join her pity party. She literally LIVED the victim mentality.<br><br>Yet, whenever anyone offered to help, she would say in a very martyred voice - &quot;oh no, don&#39;t you worry about me, I will do it myself&quot;- and then, in the next breath, complain AGAIN about how no one ever helps her. It was manipulative to a disgusting degree, interspersed with her hate-filled rants against people. Her racism was also offensive.<br><br>After I disowned her - she and ex-father had done things that should have landed them in jail - whenever people asked about my family, I would say that I no longer had contact, and sometimes I explained why. There were people who judged me for disowning those toxic people. I responded by kicking them out of my life - I wasn&#39;t going to tolerate anyone who expected me to go back to abusive people simply because &quot;but they&#39;re faaamily&quot;. <br><br>My siblings still kept in touch with their parents - and not only tolerated but enabled their toxic behaviours. And that cost one married brother his marriage - his wife and kids got fed up with the way he allowed his parents to treat them. I knew from that alone that I had made the right choice in kicking out two vile people out of my life.<br><br>Watching these videos about the infamous Tammy has reminded me of the extreme guilt tripping, pathological lies, gas lighting, rewriting reality, and shameless manipulation I endured from my ex-mother. She was innately dishonest with herself and with others, plays the victim card like a champion, and still uses my spineless brother as her lackey because she refuses to change her ways. And he is a full-fledged enabler and doormat.<br><br>I am grateful that I found the right sort of counsellor decades ago, who helped me recognise just how toxic these family members were and are. And these days, I don&#39;t feel a shred of guilt or shame about having kicked those people out of my life. It&#39;s about caring enough about my wellbeing to remove everyone and everything toxic out of my life, so they can no longer damage me. I now enjoy freedom and peace.
I had a friend who lost a significant amount of weight. Despite how much I wanted to lose weight, but failing miserably though now I&#39;m down 70 pounds and just a little more to go, I only felt happy for her. While I do wish to be skinny and what not, I just can&#39;t see myself getting upset at someone for putting the work into getting fit. I also want bigger breast but I don&#39;t hate my friends who have a bigger chest than me. I think it also comes down to maturity levels as well. I can&#39;t see a mature person getting that angry and jealous over someone else&#39;s success. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s just what I think. Just because I hate my body and self, doesn&#39;t mean that I wouldn&#39;t want someone else to stay unhealthy either. That&#39;s just weird. I took my issue and turned it into motivation to try to get me to lose weight. I just want to finally feel pretty, or at least don&#39;t feel like a whale. I probably will always feel that way but still. That and I want to find a man who will love me, even though I know it&#39;s a far fetched fantasy. It&#39;s so far beyond fantasy that it&#39;s not even in the realm of any world.
LOL fat body but snatch chin and neck? so realistic 😆
That&#39;s what my father did. Now I&#39;m engaged to a man who is terrified by the idea of having a girl. I sincerely believe by the time our children are old enough to have these social issues, the world will be past some of this, thanks to good people who got involved, like Brett.
I watched this when i was pretty into my anorexia and I remember the ways they tried to &#39;scare&#39; the skinny people were laughable.
My grandmother died of complications of long term out of control diabetes. She was morbidly obese for years.<br>The last time I saw her she had both legs amputated to the hips.  She died the next day.<br>Talk about motivation.
As someone living in UK, I thought this show would make me lose weight and I’m still fat 13 years later 😂😂
I was about to comment that I&#39;ve never felt insecure about my appearance, even though I&#39;m not exactly a D-cup model with long flowing hair xD But then I remembered the first time I went to Paris and how me and my sister felt like absolute trolls. Sure, we&#39;re skinny, but being Dutch, we felt so tall and unelegant compared to all the petite girls with thick, dark hair and mysterious dark eyes there. Somehow, everyone we saw in Paris who was our age, was ridiculously attractive looking. So yeah, I don&#39;t get insecure easily, but when surrounded by people who are all more elegant than I am... I totally get the feeling.
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
&quot;There&#39;s only two kinds of guys who wear Hawaiian shirts: gay guys and big fat party animals.&quot; --Homer Simpson
My father left me but praise the Lord for the presence of my grandpa who I&#39;ve always looked up to. It made me create a standard that I would find someone who can love me unconditionally. Hehehe! So blessed, indeed!
Pushing mothers and fathers into parenthood, and people running away from responsibilities is what is destroying the country. Be responsible of your own actions.
Ain&#39;t nobody having starbucks, mcdonalds and soda everyday confused about why theyre fat
I CANNOT with the nails-anything in public!! I work in an office and i can hear my boss clipping his nails in his office next to me and then i hear my mom (she works with me) in her cubicle filing hers and it sounds like someone is sanding wood to me. My father in law carries little clippers in his pocket and pulls them out and trims away like sitting on our couch or standing in the kitchen and i just have to leave the room and clean extra later (my in laws are otherwise super lovely so i bite my tongue on this). 😳🙈🙉🤢
fat phobia people just need to unalive themselves
Im gonna make eye contact with the nearst fat person that walks by the gym when im lifting... ive only recently started so it&#39;ll probably not look at all impressive or threatening but I want them to feel offended because they choose to be.
The things i have heard from pediatricians, would make you cry. Parents never once giving their child water or juice to drink. Instead it is Soda, chocolate milk, sweet tea, coffee etc. &quot;He just loves mcdonalds nuggets&quot; &quot;He is so big and strong for his age&quot;...No lady he is fat, cause you are feeding him garbage.
Can this entire cultural shift toward thinking it is healthy to be fat end please? I&#39;ve had enough of this &quot;it&#39;s bad to be thin&quot; nonsense.
I would read the comments on Supersize vs Superskinny episodes, and be very worried about the number of people in the comments saying &quot;Anyone with an ED here?&quot; &quot;This show makes me feel better about my ED!&quot; &quot;This triggers my ED but I can&#39;t stop watching!&quot;
Things that might persuade me to vote for a Republican…<br><br>1, recognize that your most ardent supporters are a dying breed.<br>Two, embrace the changing demographics of this country.<br>Three, it’s fine to have your own personal religious beliefs and moral convictions (I’m a Christian myself) and of course you have every right and are strongly encouraged to live by them, but stop trying to turn your personal religious beliefs/moral convictions into law.<br>Four, listen to all your constituents’ concerns and work for all of them as you were hired to do, not just the ones who agree with you.<br>Five, loudly, publicly, forcefully, unapologetically and continuously condemn those within your party (no matter what percentage they may be) who give all of you a bad name; that applies to liberals/Democrats as well. you don’t want to be lumped in with racists, antisemitic people, white supremacists, confederacy lovers and/or bigots of any kind? Stop letting them speak for/represent you; show everyone, especially minority groups that in no way, shape or form will you stand for any of that.<br>Six, for all the talk about cracking down on illegal immigration and what not, start holding business owners who exploit those who enter this country illegally and pay them under the table accountable for their part in it. also, why not create a pathway to citizenship for those who while yes, enter this country illegally, work hard to support themselves and their families? Also the ones who were brought here illegally as infants/toddlers should be granted citizenship instead of one day being deported back to places they can’t even remember living in.<br>Seven, embrace the teaching of the good, the bad and the absolute downright ugly of this country‘s history and ways in which, yes, said history has had lasting effects on the present no matter how big or small. It does no one any good to deny history and it’s continuing ramifications, and only when we are finally honest with ourselves and each other can we truly work towards a better America; it will be an ongoing, never ending quest, but it can be done.<br>Eight, get behind some sort of healthcare reform. I don’t know if universal healthcare, Medicare for all or anything like that is a solution to the problem, but people shouldn’t have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for doctors appointments, hospital visits, major or minor procedures, medications prescribed to them etc. people shouldn’t have to forgo food, rent/mortgage payments, utilities etc. and risk eviction, foreclosure on their homes and/or disconnection of utilities to pay for those things. again I’m not sure what the solution is, but surely the richest country on the face of the planet can do better than what we’ve done.<br>Nine, of course people who are perfectly capable of working shouldn’t be allowed to abuse any form of government assistance; Social Security/disability, welfare, food stamps and stuff like that. However, those who are honestly trying, are underemployed even though they’re perfectly capable or who literally can’t work/help themselves shouldn’t have to pay the price. Ending those benefits/programs won’t help anyone.<br><br>There are other things on the list, but that’s all I’ve been able to think of for now.
What helped me change my relationship to food was intermittent fasting. Sure, plenty of people binge eat into a surplus during their window. But for me it was huge to train my brain not to he eating all day every day. Now that hunger and craving signal doesn&#39;t even come on until lunch, and it doesn&#39;t come on strong. I eat a plate of eggs for lunch (like 300 calories and 25g protein) and then don&#39;t get hungry until dinner, where I finally have a very large meal. I eat my protein and fiber first at the meal, and can never seem to finish the carbs. Because of that, I don&#39;t even cook carbs sometimes, knowing I&#39;m not going to eat them and would rather just eat more meat anyways. Also yogurt is an excellent snack. Sure it&#39;s full of sugar, but if you use it to replace actual just sugary empty calories, then you&#39;re at least getting some protein and vitamins while you succumb to your sugar cravings.<br><br>Honestly, eat as much protein as you can stomach and there won&#39;t be much room for too many calories. I&#39;m stuffed for hours after five eggs and it&#39;s 350 calories. If you need to bulk up your meals, pick whatever green veggies you like. I love broccoli and can eat a lot of it. Trick is don&#39;t be afraid to add some fat/oil to nutritious foods. They&#39;ll taste much better and you&#39;re still getting their nutrients with an essential fatty acid boost.
If you need some more material, I give you a (dr?) Ewa Dąbrowska who is a propagator of &quot;detox&quot; vegetable fast. She claims she can cure anything from cancer, throu thytoid malfunctions to allergies. My mom is going through her fast once or twice a year and she won&#39;t listen to me when I&#39;m saying it does more harm than good... The woman worked at the Gdansk Medical University, she calls herself a doctor, books and articles quote her as if she had a PhD, but at the same time her website says she never had a public dissertation because she found intetest in fasting... The only scientific article I found with her as an author is her unfinished dissertation. Anything else is just bullshit for newspapers. And so freaking many people believe her... How eating 400 kcal a day from vegetables only (no fat, no protein- you are not allowed to eat beans during the fast) can heal your thyroid?
I&#39;d like to find a better, sugar-coated synonym for what I believe ashley graham is that doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m coming from hate but I&#39;m not wasting my time surfing Merriam webster to get it. I find her disgusting. That&#39;s the term. But not physically, just morally and ethically.<br><br>After all, most of her pictures are photoshopped and she has the perfect face. Otherwise, she would be in a trashcan and canceled on the spot. <br><br>These last years have been filled with fat acceptance that only applies to humans and more specifically to women because men are shamed. Check the tabloids. <br>If you take your fat cat or dog to a friend&#39;s house, everybody will have a laugh. If you take that same animal to the vet, the animal will be put immediately on a strict diet because being fat is damaging even to them according to vets.<br><br>Now, this goes way past fat acceptance. As a man, I&#39;ve struggled all my life with muscle growth, fatness, and body shape. I can say with certainty that I&#39;ve had all the mental issues related to those but no help whatsoever. Much less &#39;&#39;acceptance&#39;&#39;. Only mockery. And I&#39;ve truly done it all to remedy that but I can&#39;t fight my organism. I&#39;m not &#39;&#39;V&#39;&#39; shape, I&#39;ve wasted lots of money on musculation, healthy eating, and fitness and no results but I can&#39;t go ahead and blame planet earth for my genes much less demand humankind to like me. And I&#39;ve come to terms with that in a very healthy way. I&#39;m not endorsing my body type or going on a crusade to have it be accepted. My body is what it is and personal acceptance is a process that is precisely that...personal. You either get there or you don&#39;t. Requires willpower. <br><br>Obviously, I don&#39;t get the attention a woman gets in 2020 neither do I want to but it&#39;s a process of self-acceptance. The bible says &#39;&#39;love thy neighbor&#39;&#39;. Love thy neighbor refers to doing what&#39;s best for others and I would NEVER tell people to settle with unhappiness if they can do something about what makes them unhappy. And I wouldn&#39;t go after Calvin Klein for their ads or Abercrombie because that is INSANE like fat women went after victoria&#39;s secret until they made sure they destroyed it.<br><br>The best I can do is try to accept myself with I have been and I&#39;ve been pretty successful in doing just that. But this right here... with the women&#39;s fat adoration movement is damaging.<br>Are we gonna wake up and realize that? I hope but I doubt it.
I used to be a fat person. I was about 330 pounds.<br><br>I got tired of being sick, so I got serious about it and three years ago start losing weight <br><br>Today I’m 220 pounds and when I tell you, it’s a world of difference I mean it’s a freaking world of difference <br><br>I would never hate on fat people because I understand what they’re going through but it is a choice and they need to understand. Some people are making a better choice than them and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Sorry, but gaining body fat is not a scientific question as much as it is an evolutionary question...
I remember going to a music festival a few years ago in Rimini, near Bologna Italy. I loved the beaches but I know a lot of Italian&#39;s say the beaches there suck 🤣<br><br>There were no McDonald&#39;s or fast food places within several miles. Nearly EVERYONE was in great shape, it completely put me to shame. I saw like 2 overweight people (1 of them sadly being myself,) there over the 3-4 days I visited, I couldn&#39;t believe it. Everyone was either lean or near jacked. Then came back to my home city in the north of the UK and it was business as usual, about 50% of people obese.....
Same. I was 260 at my heaviest. I will never be the skinny kid in my heart. Some of my<br>Coworkers think of me as the “skinny guy” despite the fact that I don’t have any veins, my waist is 31”, I have bad cardio, etc.<br>Hearing that they think I’m skinny doesn’t really help. In the moment it might make me feel better about myself, but in the long term it makes me only feel like a fraud… I don’t really handle compliments well because of the time that I was fat and all the fake compliments I got trying to get a rise out of me, no real affection for my entire teenage years through to adulthood.<br>Since losing the weight my confidence has gone up but not to a level where I feel confident. I just feel like I’m constantly on the verge of tears because I have no self-image anymore and I have no idea who to trust.
Parents are to blame they don&#39;t educate themselves or learn how to cook, obestiality is everywhere,, Mac Donald&#39;s being the worst out let for junk food,  children are not born fat, it&#39;s the parents fault for being uneducated and lazy fact
Would LOVE for you to cover Supersize vs Superskinny and see your view on that show.
Ironic, isn&#39;t it?   An American reporting on obese British children.  And where did McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, etc., come to Britain from?
I truly do not like to see fat stomachs out in crop tops. Like...it doesn&#39;t fit! Just pick a different shirt
Many of the problems humans have are because society have developed faster than the human brain. The human brain looks for food. It used to be hard to get food.. therefore no overeating. Nowadays we have an abundance of food at our fingertips, all the time. So the human brain thinks &quot;must eat and store fat for the time there&#39;s a lack of food&quot;. Our brains haven&#39;t developed fast enough.
And back in the days my mother was like a racer without any preparation, just went into the car, get it ready up and on and drive off like a smooth maniac<br><br>As for my father, we had one time where it took him 10-15 minutes just to get from the parking spot to the gate of the mall which takes only 1-2 minutes if you were to walk there going the same road as the car at the parking spot<br>I love my family
I don&#39;t live in the UK anymore but we also have obese folks here now too. Growing up there was 1, yes ONE McDonald&#39;s restaurant in my town of fewer than 800 000 people. Now there are 10 McDonald&#39;s, 5 burger kings, 3 five guys, Edwards sandwich places, KFC Starbucks all over. What do most of these places have in common? Super size V super skinny was on when us style fast food was just starting to grow in the UK. They were not flexing they were trying to prevent the bad habits from forming. Warn people of the coming storm. Yes England invented capitalism but the us weaponised it. When you have socialised Medical care such as the NHS or SECU the govt uses media to cushion the blow of upcoming crisis. Because everything is free it puts more responsibility on the citizens to adjust their behaviour for the greater good. Super size as well as embarrassing bodies were part of an effort to make a generation who had never known rationing or war to be more conscious of the ways their behaviour affects other and the nation. Watching probably re-edited episodes years later without the long ass public service messages at the start and end is a very different experience. Not specifying these details as one complains about the finger pointing....come on...no no dear. This show exists in a social, economic and cultural context and you know it. I have my issues with Dr. discount Benedict Cumberbatch but he and those 2 other Dr ladies he worked with on ITV were trying to do good not only for the people but for the NHS in the sweet sweet summer pre Brexit days.
I’m a kid of the 80s &amp; I remember when Janet Jackson first started making music videos. I thought she was not only adorable, but glad that she wasn’t one of the “skinny Minnie’s”. I was a curvy teen! Not overweight, but certainly not skinny, like was so trendy in those days.  She got such flack &amp; I hated it. She eventually transformed into a more athletic body &amp; I was happy for her.
The super skinny thing it&#39;s for me hard to gain any real weight unless it&#39;s muscle no fat at all I tried the big Mac diet to gain and loss 3 pounds I&#39;m 128 now at 5,6 but that&#39;s with muscle, lowest was 113 when I got lazy n didn&#39;t work out but I ate like a horse at that, most I weighed was 139 with more muscle then I do now in my prime at 25 im 41 now , not annarexic but not that big eather ,and can&#39;t gain a damn pound of fat at all any where , I&#39;ve had trouble keeping weight ,I don&#39;t smoke I don&#39;t drink , eat a good amount ,work out i do karate and weights ,don&#39;t eat junk food hate sweets unless it fruite hard to gain for me acualy sucks cold a lot
&quot;all I had was four pieces of pizza for breakfast, four pieces of pizza for lunch, and two cheeseburgers and some fries for dinner! Also i dunked all my pizza in a tablespoon of Caesar dressing with every bite, ate my fries covered in mayo and gravy and cheese, and washed every meal down with a liter of soda! I&#39;m still hungry! Why am I fat?&quot;<br><br>Yeah that&#39;s not a lot of food, but just by eating vegetables and meat (steak or chicken) and only drinking water or black coffee you could eat thrice as much and still be taking in the same amount of calories.<br><br>There&#39;s no excuse and there&#39;s no getting around it. If you consume more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. If you burn more calories than you consume, you will lose weight. Want gain weight eat more, want lose weight eat less, simple as 🤷‍♂️
Last May, I&#39;ve just realized I was at the moment considered overweight and it was panicking me because everyone around me told me that losing weight is really hard and that you need to be hungry all the time to make it works. But since I was overweight I decided I wanted to lose weight and be in control of my health. I started following you and other channels that spoke about how to lose weight and critics the fat acceptance movement. Now, almost 1 year afterward, I&#39;m very proud to say that you helped me lose 22 lbs (10 kg) and I&#39;m not overweight anymore, perfectly normal, I&#39;m still trying to lose extra 11lbs but I&#39;m ok with them. Thank you for your channel! :)))
I actually prefer the realness of this show, who actually would want the fake smiles and all this said behind your fatty back then in your face?
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
How about all those fat old people… Oh yeah, there aren’t any.
A lot of these fat acceptance people take half of a fact they kinda heard and run with it. Like being super lean 24/7 is unsustainable for most people because to do that you either have to be on tren or in a calorie deficit, both of which will cause health problems if continued for a long period of time. It is healthy to have some fat on you, however the healthy range is 18-30% depending on gender and genetics (some peoples bodies just work different. Though between 25 and 30% can still be healthy so long as ur eating healthy, drinking enough water and exercising enough. Clean bulks aren’t gonna cause any significant health problems). There is a point when it’s too much. Or how a lot of them say that 90% of the time dieting doesn’t work (I’ve heard eating healthy at all doesn’t work too, and that person is gonna die), which is true in reference to fad diets and changing your entire diet cold turkey. Making slow and gradual changes, finding healthy recipes you enjoy, not being super restrictive and meal prepping at least one meal every week is the key to long term success. The reason why fad diets don’t work is because the people who do them don’t understand nutrition and will just go back to eating how they used to after they’ve lost all the weight. The reason why cold turkey doesn’t work is because it leads to burnout. It’s the same reason being super restrictive doesn’t work, and on the people it does, it also borders on disordered eating and often there’s a correlation with an unhealthy relationship with food (Im not talking about athletes or something temporarily being super restrictive before like a weigh in or a show or something, Im talking about the instagram “nutritionists” who are like “you can’t eat bread, seed oil, meat, vegetables, water, milk ect.” They’re also the same ones who drink bleach because they believe it gives them health benefits. Basically the jilly juice mfs).
I think there&#39;s always some truth to obese people claims they don&#39;t eat as much. Some do eat as much as a lot of smaller sized people do. It really has a lot to do with personal differences in metabolism and physiology, many of which we could not fathom to understand.
I watched this when i was pretty into my anorexia and I remember the ways they tried to &#39;scare&#39; the skinny people were laughable.
Ok Ashley and Amy, don&#39;t you think that thin people have feelings too??????  It&#39;s as if you are on a bandwagon downing thin folks &quot;WHY&quot;.  I have never starved myself, and I surely never WHINE about what others are or are not eating.  Why would I care? I myself practice a Keto and Bullet Proof meal plan (not diet) 90% of the time maybe more - only because I feel amazing when I don&#39;t have all the sugar in my body.  I have never in my life counted calories.  If size doesn&#39;t matter then why the heck are you dwelling on it non-stop the entire interview - its as if it&#39;s your HOOK and Mission to continue downing anyone that is not your large... and it&#39;s old news.  When we stop bringing all the attention to this expired message - no one will give a F.... Seriously.  It&#39;s as if you are promoting Fat and Big Girls - A Big Women and Men Unite Message (It&#39;s Us against the THIN People - how immature that is - when you think about it.  I love when talk shows give rewards for people who&#39;s lost 100 pounds - I&#39;m kidding... I&#39;m not a fan - what about the people who never gained 100 pounds in the first place and loved their bodies enough to eat for nourishment and other healthy reasons.  Where&#39;s their reward?  Don&#39;t want one - just enjoy feeling good - because feeling good is the reward.  The point is - get over the weight and size issues and complaining.  And....you have to ask Amy what size she is - that alone is irrelivant ... why don&#39;t we move-on to a productive conversation, that&#39;s much more exciting and INTERESTING.  Many of us don&#39;t care how big or small you are and if we do - then we are the one with the problem.  Silence is the most powerful message and when you don&#39;t give it worth or value - it fades fast.  When we stop caring about what others think of us - then and only then, we&#39;ve really grown as whole.  I&#39;m just so tired of the We are Large/Big/Fat and we love it message.  If a think person were to say I love being thin/pretty/sexy then we are the bad guy and shame on us....Just giving an example here.  Great &quot;you&#39;re big and love the way it feels on &quot;you&quot; but let us move on.  And one last thing.  The whole REVERSE CASTING IN THE MEDIA etc. - now says..... if you are thin and pretty, you are not &quot;real&quot; In casting many say - We want &quot;Real People&quot; wow that is sad that we&#39;ve come to that - another form of discrimination in REVERSE.   It&#39;s the other side of Discrimination and many won&#39;t recognize that because they are angry/mad/bitter and the list goes on....  I&#39;ve never hated on anyone because of the way they looked or their size.  And yet, this is where we are - comparing everyone.  It&#39;s all backwards thinking and non-productive.  And now..... if you say anything... share how you FEEL.... it&#39;s considered political incorrect.  It&#39;s just wrong in way you dice it up.  you can&#39;t breath in the wrong direction anymore. Yes, there are bullies and mean insensitive people on the planet - but the only way we get past it is to start focusing on the opposite and the positives and how can we be the best version of ourselves.  How can we give back, what can we go better.  Where&#39;s that convo?  This conversation is so stale and self-involved and mentions nothing about &quot;giving, sharing, loving etc.  All you 2 discuss is your size and all the issues that go along with it.  It&#39;s just not interesting and who is it helping by ranting and dwelling on the obvious?  I like you both a lot --and I was hoping for an exiting and interesting interview, but you lost my attention fast and this are just parting words I felt I could share - since there is a comments section:)
I grew up in the deep south during the 70s, raised by parents, a father from up North and a mother from the Westcoast. My grandparents founded the Church of Christ in this town which was a multi cultural denomination. I was raised to treat each person by how they treated me as well as others, racism was not allowed in our home which made me completely different from the kids I would grow up with, it cost me friends, popularity, and exposed me to bullying and harassment but I am so thankful for the words my father said to me that I still live by &quot;Never judge someone by what they look like judge them instead by their words and actions&quot; I didn&#39;t know how blessed I was back then to have parents who taught me the right way to treat people but I will forever be thankful they did.
Notice that the men are fit and the women are fat. The bar is so incredibly low for women. It also goes for their personality, the bar is set incredibly low for women. Being a woman is western society is so incredibly easy, all that they have to do to be considered attractive is not eat too much.
These morbidly obese and also normopeople HAVE TO CALM DOWN !<br>Mind your business
You looked good with that &quot;baby fat&quot; Ben!
The US of A is going rapidly into decline, and nowhere is this more obvious than in their so-called culture wars. Its citizens are encouraged to become unhealthily mega-fat through its addiction to mega-consumption, then the poor slobs are shamed for being unhealthily mega-fat, then the same slobs are told, no, it is beautiful to be unhealthily mega-fat... because the fashion labels say so and they want Walmart to share a bit of the XXL clothing market. Just keep those muffin and McFlurry supply lines going 🤣🤣
If you’re obese by choice, I shouldn’t have to pay for your healthcare.
I was chubby as a child, imagine going to fat camp, and then realized, &quot;bruh i can literally lose weight myself&quot;
Fat doc seems like she tried to lose weight thinking it only a matter of going to the gym and she didn&#39;t lose weight, got frustrated, and decided &quot;eh I don&#39;t have to lose weight&quot; 😂😂😂
I watch these to get ideas for food lmao...it&#39;s so eye opening sometimes. Like the only reason I don&#39;t look like that, the only reason I&#39;m not obese is because I&#39;m puking everything I eat. But I&#39;m just as food-obsessed, I eat just as much.
if you look like me you get tazed. kicked and charged with assault. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23imthatugly">#imthatugly</a>
I’ve always struggled with weight fluctuations and it’s always been in an unhealthy way. 10 years ago I lost a lot of weight because I had to be healthy due to being pregnant but after I had my child I didn’t keep it off and went back to bad habits again. Fast forward to now and I have a greater understanding on how to be healthier, I’ve lost about 5kg (11lb) give or take in the last month and I feel like I’m absolutely on the right track. I’m a lot happier and am proud of myself for gaining the strength to do this. What annoys me is that when I was at my heaviest people would tell me I looked fine and that I’m not fat etc when I clearly was LOL.
I&#39;m physically fit and shredded with a 6 pack abs and I couldn&#39;t be happier. Get off you&#39;re butt and make the change in you&#39;re life you are to lazy to make. It&#39;s not hard it just takes motivation and attitude to make it happen for anyone who thinks they are trapped being in a fat body. Make it happen!!!!
Ego vs intuition basically. Discipline the ego, basically what answer every religion and philosophist came too. I&#39;m glad people are noticing spirituality and such more, just sad people are only now realizing it to come too the surface. People needing guidance, remember, lots of answer within meditation, eating healthy, anything that would heighten the intuition, not the ego. There&#39;s a reason christianity says we go to hell for indulging in cravings, murder and so on. But read it more metaphorically, the ego gets stronger whenever we feed it, the ego then suffers more, reason why they use the term &quot;hell&quot;, if people read everything metaphorically you&#39;ll notice a lot of religions/way of life, like buddhism, hinduism, christianity, etc... they were all talking about higher cosnciousness, basically feeding the intuition instead/disciplining the ego. We knew it for 1000&#39;s of years, most people just take religion too literally, but really, there&#39;s a lot to learn about how the psychè and ego works in mostly hinduism and buddhism. Christianity has been changed a lot for propaganda purposes, but the old testament teaches more about it. The new one is a bit more materialistic, reason why some christians these days are waay too Karen. <br><br>Anyway, if you don&#39;t feel like reading any religion you could also check out Carl Jung, he talks a lot about shadow work and founded analytical psychology. He&#39;s also the one who studied the unconscious state and so fourth, like the four archetypes like the Self, the Persona, the Shadow and the Anima/Animus. The shadow being everything about yourself you don&#39;t see as positive, and the anima/animus which is the masculine and feminine side. Anima is the man&#39;s internal other, the feminine. Animus on the other hand is a woman&#39;s internal other, the masculine. Balancing both can help you in creating stability, like courage and on the other side empathy. Lots of people these days are unbalanced, either too fragile or too aggressive. Lots of it can stem from parents splitting up, not having a father/mother figure, it can also stem from lots of processed food, which is known to decrease testosterone in men, not sure about women. Aggressiveness can also stem from too huge of a ego, something that alcohol increases, which is why so many are depressed when drinking. It all connects, there&#39;s a reason why religion looks down on alcohol and such. Psychedelics work the other way, diminishing the ego, helps you see the world clearer without the emotional fog and so on. A reason why psychedelics have helped so many people with addiction, the ego is what is addicted, psychedelics also rewrites thought patterns, making it easier to write healthy new one. Philosophy and religion always knew about it, christianity may just have muddied the whole picture of what religion is, hinduism and buddhism teaches about you, how to overcome your mind/ego and live a happy life, all based on psychology and spirituality. What people get wrong is that spirituality is about believing something that isn&#39;t real. Yes, christianity says this, but spirituality is about reaching your higher self, disciplining your ego and showing love and empathy, which is all what the intuition is about. Sure, religion can be stories, but hinduism and buddhism is a way of life, yes, it does have stories, but most read it literally, and metaphorically. Example, the gods in hinduism all tells a story, the gods are based on love, death, ego and so fourth. Reading through the lines will make you understand the &quot;gods&quot; are just metaphors for the different emotions you have, the stories deepening your understanding of these emotions. <br><br>I&#39;m not religious, I was an atheist but now a theist. I&#39;ve studied all of them and see similarities in all of them, so I see how every religion can help you. I do believe every &quot;God&quot; people have seen has been under the influence of psychedelics though, and that every God is the same entity, just people having different viewpoints on what a higher power should look like. Are you christian and take mushrooms, well, you might as well see Jesus or something. I&#39;m saying besides the &quot;Gods&quot; there are actual knowledge to living a better life. I do believe there&#39;s something higher, but what, I don&#39;t know, all i know is that people has known how to live a spiritual happy life centuries ago, so there must be something giving them the knowledge. People have been known to have psychedelic experiences where they&#39;ve been shown what happiness is and how to live by it. Easily said, the ego is what suffers. Enjoy the little things, have a positive life but also a disciplined one, comfort is what ruins us. This was really long, but yeah, it&#39;s all my knowledge though the years connecting psychology, psychedelics and religion/spirituality.<br><br>Being uncomfortable also increases dopamine and other chemicals like norepinephrine, which is why people do yoga, ice baths, meditation on spike mats and feel way better afterwards. <br><br>You should check out channels like Sky Life, Seek Discomfort and Yes Theory, they all got different examples of exposing yourself to uncomfortable things :)
I get so confused when Ashley describes herself as white because she looks mixed race to me. Would love to see a pic of her real father, because she does not look white.
What my mum and i alwayd found interesting was that the majority of people on this show, if you took what they ate and portioned it to standard calories, they were still unheathly. The super skinny were rarely skinny from eating just vegetables etc, they were skinny from jusy eating ultra processed foods, but barely anything of it.
One time I tried to walk in an A&amp;F store.<br>It was dark, creepy, and a forcefully beachy cologne attacked my nostrils. <br>Rather than tempt fate further, I<br>fled to the safety of the Yankee Candles and never looked back.
Thank you dear father Amen
Fat is not an identity; it’s a condition.
I am a med student and we study so much about how obesity is a risk factor for numerous diseases, focusing on mechanisms of how being obese specifically affect different organ system. I cannot fathom how this person is a doctor and still chose to overlook all that researched information?
I&#39;m glad I watched this video, as someone who&#39;s struggled with being the chubby kid all my life, when i looked through your channel I got extremely bad vibes. Because I am someone activeley working on myself. Eating better, exercising, everything. But when I saw your videos all I saw were clickbait titles and I got very uncomfortable. I wasn&#39;t even aware of this fat positive movement, I was only ever aware of the bigger body positive movement. Which I am very much in support of. And I&#39;m glad you clarified obese because a lot of people think overweight and obese are the same thing and they very much aren&#39;t.
You are so ugly
this whole fat acceptance movement? let&#39;s just let them do what they do, why do we even bother keep warning them of health issues if they refuse to change for the better? i&#39;d say live and let die.<br><br>let&#39;s focus on ourselves and let natural selection run it&#39;s course
speaking as a fat guy myself... yes, if a person is overweight, they are eating far too much.
Carnivore diet is super cool to try, I have tried it and I felt amazing; I had binge eating episodes and with canivore diet (high fat high protein) I didn&#39;t have one! though I missed the freshness of veggies so I added green beans and it was amazing! <br>I&#39;d say that canivore diet really helped with my depression and my sensory sensitivity (misophonia). Give it a try and see for yourself if it benefits you.
The poorest ppl  in America are the fattest. No one is starving here!
It’s those toxic parents - decent parents don’t have obese children
I found The Mayo Clinic Diabetes Diet book by Donald D. Hensrud in April of 2021 and this is the best diet I have ever encountered.  It is not a low carb diet and it is so easy to follow.  It recommends eating a serving of fruit with every meal and having nonstarchy vegetables with meals. It has you measure your protein, carbs and fat (very low fat) with your meals and tells you how many to have each day based on how many calories a day you want to eat.  I love this diet and have successfully lost weight and kept the majority of the weight off.  I was miserable trying to follow a low carb diet in the past and had no idea I could be so happy following The Mayo Clinic Diabetes Diet.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=4m45s">4:45</a> in all fairness that statistic isn&#39;t really a comparison. one thing to credit the USA on there is the honesty of the statistic, when they say you&#39;re obese you are ACTUALLY obese. UK it not the same, most people branded &quot;Obese&quot; are above average weight at best. <br><br>I&#39;m a 5&#39;10, male - weighing at 15.4 stone(215.6 pounds?) and I&#39;m considered obese... When reality is im actually quite average in size. I fit most medium size clothing which at ideal weight(in with the UK claims is 12 stone- 168pound- at max) will still be my clothing fit.
I&#39;m among those referred to as  &#39;Thin people&#39; <br><br>Everyday we thin people are planning and scheming! Our goal is to hit obese people where it hurts, their so-called &quot;body positivity&quot; movement.. <br><br><br>The plan is already set in motion, thin people are at their posts ready to strike!<br><br>We need to hijack the movement itself, in order to remove the one thing fat people have, so they will suffer! <br><br>Us thin people strive on others suffering, especially fat people.
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
This girl helped me lose 40lbs during her first season of weight loss videos and I genuinely believed I was being healthy and developing a healthy relationship with food but then out of nowhere after I found your videos I realised I wasn&#39;t being healthy and I was just hating myself and punishing myself for something that I didn&#39;t need to be punished for. I still struggle with food cravings and my weight now but I want to be more proactive with my eating and figure out what&#39;s best for me. I&#39;ve started going to the gym so I can build up stamina and muscle whilst trying my hardest to ignore the scale (I have to keep telling myself muscle weighs more than fat) and I can already feel my legs toning up and the muscles in my arms building up. I still struggle with my body image and still see myself as some fat, overweight blob but I&#39;m hopefully getting somewhere and hopefully soon I can work on changing that.
The only woman who exercises and is still fat.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=0m02s">0:02</a> all the skinny people bar the blonde woman fourth from left are all normal skinny. Not super skinny.
Fat people are funny 😅😂
The name is a bit off putting, but I actually like the show. I do like that in general they try to avoid super skinny people that would be unfit for the show, like folks who have anorexia and who need deeper therapeutic help to eat more.
I remember seeing him from the start and thought it was disgusting; still do and to purposely get morbidly obese is a bad image to fans who are younger.
Maybe they shouldn&#39;t hold a lesson in fat camps on how to approach everything psychologically. For example how to defend yourself against enablers. I would be really interested in that too. My work colleague, for example Always makes me feel bad when I do 18:6 intermittent fasting or OMAD. She always says &quot;Oh, that little bit of snacking doesn&#39;t make you fat, I got it for us, etc. She gets really angry. At that time she was my only colleague, so I gave in for the sake of peace and of course because of my inner bastard .<br>At least she agreed to pretzel sticks at some point, but it still breaks my fast. She also often brought sweet drinks, which is nice too... but as I said, it doesn&#39;t help at all. And I got back into the habit of eating around the clock. I found that very frustrating, even if it wasn&#39;t entirely her fault, I wished for more support and to this day I don&#39;t know how to behave in such a situation, luckily now i have fewer shifts with her. But last time she brought a whole cheesecake from the bakery, that&#39;s my total weakness!!Then she really only takes a little bit and gives me the rest to take home! and when I tell her I&#39;m fasting again, she say things like &quot;Oh, not that you&#39;ll get in a bad mood again&quot; (I don&#39;t get in a bad mood though, that was only once when I tried to go without sugar for a month just for fun and that was before 2 years!). It&#39;s so hard and sometimes I feel like she wants to see me fail. I don&#39;t understand why she&#39;s mad just because I don&#39;t want to snake with her, she can do it without me. :(<br><br>I feel really sorry for these children with parents like that and I imagine a fat camp would be really fun if it was a good one. I was never fat as a child, it has happened to me since I started working. Now I&#39;m almost at grade 2 obesity :(  I&#39;ve become a total stress eater.
Ironic, isn&#39;t it?   An American reporting on obese British children.  And where did McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, etc., come to Britain from?
&quot;Cut the blood suply to fat&quot; yeah impossible and even if it was possible u need blood flow to get rid of fat
This is why whenever I feel heavy and wanna loose the extra fat I eat my local food once a day and then eat fruits for the rest of the day to replace my cravings for sugary snacks and it works like magic and I feel good and lighter too.
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
Fat activist find changing their diet and lifestyle so difficult that changing the world seems like an easier task. Virgi says she&#39;s failed countless diets in the past. I suspect she&#39;d have a different song to sing if she was successful.
&#39;Releasing fat!&quot; 🤣BTW isn&#39;t eating less than 300 Calories &#39;deadly&#39;? Please do not go for these bizarre diets guys, exercising/walking/swimming are the best ways to reduce weight along with a &#39;Normal&#39; junk-free diets.
Sometimes they aren’t even fat they’re just not conventionally attractive
Not sure where this falls in the whole self-deception or secret eating category, but I have trouble losing weight due to psych issues. I had a complete mental breakdown and lost a ton of weight. An unhealthy amount, in fact. I had to be forced to eat. Now that I’ve recovered, I’m obese. Every time I try to lose weight and start seeing results, I self sabotage because being thin, in my mind, equates to being “sick.” I haven’t managed to break through that psychological barrier, yet. No obese-related health scare has hit hard enough to overpower that initial belief.

As someone that used to be obese when I was younger, I feel the  &quot;junkfood&quot;  effect  just hearing the word TLC . And I could get &quot;psychological diabetes&quot; if I watch too much of it. So thank you for balancing it out with some healthy insight!
the only problem with your stupid bs argument Ben is that your basis for it is based in some made up bullshit about a floaty dude in the sky that lives in a castle of gold and if you worship him enough you will go there when you die. You supporting the ABOLISHMENT of ALL FORMS OF ABORTION means that women who are going to have a fatal delivery, or a child that will be born into pain and disability and never have a life worth living, all those options to abort DANGEROUS pregnancies will go with it. you are a fkn idiot to say that there is no legitimacy in ANY abortion.
Gurl I had eaebuds in &quot;SKINNY&quot; 😂😅
Suger doesnt cause weight gain directly, fat does. Dairy like cheese, milk etc are superfoods designed to make babies gain weight. When you eat suger as well, you use the sugers 1st, then the other stuff like dairy get stored as fat. Too much suger while over weight means not all the suger is being used, and that causes type 2 diabetes. Reducing suger is a good idea, but stopping dairy is far more effective. Also, dont eat on a schedule, only eat when your actually hungry. Most people have no idea what actual hunger is though..
There is a WORLD of difference between bullying, shaming, and/or mistreating someone because of being overweight or obese, and creating content with the intention of respectfully educating viewers about the health risks of obesity, the media circus that is &quot;health content&quot;, and the huge role played by mindset/mental health. While not everyone has to love your content, it&#39;s frustrating that even your approach is viewed by some as hateful. As for those who see it that way, my only hope is that they get the help and support they likely need.
Not true for everyone. If it’s always restriction that prompts bingeing nobody would have ever got fat thru binge eating in the first place.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
As a person who was dealing with anorexia and bulimia, I feel offended. What she did felt like a mockery, like telling me &quot;anyone can be anorexic, it&#39;s a made-up problem&quot;. I was afraid to show my body in public. I was anxious while eating food, the fat stigma I&#39;ve experienced was hanging over me even when I was under 47g at 1.76m. I doubt that she ever had anorexia because nobody who went through this shit would make up stuff like that.<br>There is so much she could be, so much she could&#39;ve done for the body-acceptance movements and yet, she is choosing to go after fame, attention and spreading misinformation.
There are very differing opinions in carnivorous communities about who agrees or does not agree with Paul Saladino. One diet is not for all, Paul works out a lot, if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t need the same diet as him. <br><br>Yes, we ate a few plants. That&#39;s logical because if the hunt didn&#39;t succeed or went wrong or our meat storage was empty in winter times we did need the ability to eat plants of some sort. Just not any of the plants found in the grocery store today; we have developed them ourselves. Made them bigger and sweeter. <br><br>At the end the fact remains: fat and glucose are fuel, so choose one of them. Mixing them is detrimental for health and that is the real problem with an omnivore diet.
I watched this when i was pretty into my anorexia and I remember the ways they tried to &#39;scare&#39; the skinny people were laughable.

I&#39;ve never liked hot spicy food... ever. Yes, I&#39;ve eaten certain hot foods, but mild. These FLAMING HOT CHEETOS 🔥 🥵  I&#39;ve never tried and never will. It sounds as if these are nothing more than a bunch of chemicals that probably shouldn&#39;t be consumed. Drugs are made from chemicals, and drugs are addictive as we all know, so making this junk food addictive wouldn&#39;t surprise me. I saw Mtn.Dew flavored by FLAMING HOT chemicals. Why on earth would someone want to drink something that hot? <br>  If they are using Capsum for the heat and taken from peppers, as far as I know, it&#39;s an oil based substance, and drinking any cold liquid isn&#39;t going to kill the burn. Eat crackers, bread, and anything that will soak up the oil. Liquids just spread it around. I&#39;ve heard that a certain amount of Capsum boosts your metabolism. How many skinny people have you seen that love hot spicy foods? A lot of people I know that eat hot and spicy are skinny. Might be good for weight loss if you can get past the heat. LOL 😆.
OH NO NO<br>A WOMAN SO SO FAT<br>NO PLEASE NO FAT NO
The focus should be education and physical experience not the scale. <br><br>Many obese children and adults do not know WHAT physical exertion is supposed to feel like and these kids should be learning how fun it can be
If you’re obese by choice, I shouldn’t have to pay for your healthcare.
Not only is being fat unattractive, it’s bad for your health. Who knew.
People who eat it everyday are fat
Today I discovered your channel and I totally love it. A joke popped into my mind while listening to you - Yo momma is so fat I am genuinely concerned about her 😅 😂 Thanks for all the great advice ❤️
I remember watching a video about Fat Camp that they let the Kids eat the Foods that got them Fat in the first place.
I heard Fat Camp is just giving Fat Kids the Fat Food that got them Fat in the first place.
😠 Fat camp should be for the parents not for Children, to learn how to feed their kids, support and encourage them emotionally and become more active and avoid pitfalls.
Reminds me of this podcaster who claims that she eats healthy but is naturally fat, and dismisses people that say getting fat from eating less food than you burn off is impossible and breaks the laws of physics, not even debunking the point, just doing the tactic of repeating it in a mocking voice as if that debunks it.

Jokes on u my father dead
I don&#39;t understand that Body Positivity is only for obese people for the reason that they had struggle to lose weight but wasn&#39;t treated the same way for malnourished thin child from poor countries struggle to gain weight due to lack of food. Yes, thin and fat are opposite but the situation are just the same to qualify both for Body Positivity.
Equal to war crimes if you ask me.  A long miserable slow death suffocating in fat.  And the bottom line is greed.  Let&#39;s take everything we can from wherever we can until there is no more. And then throw bread crumbs to whoever is left while we bask in gluttony. In this case bread crumbs are turkey tails etc, junk meat and junk food. There really should be  better protections for people, land, air and water in every land on earth.
My father is a scientist and he&#39;s always told me that when a new medication comes out, there is no data on the long terms effects or risks. Because it&#39;s so new. So I remain sceptical about anti-aging devices for the same reason. Cause we don&#39;t really know if a few years down the road a new study will contradict today&#39;s claims.
I’m confused. Didn’t Google make their employees fat in the first place? Then they changed things so the employees just lost the weight that Google caused them to gain?
Nah, you don&#39;t hate fat people, you just think you&#39;re better than them
get strapped True Americans.  it&#39;s about to get real ugly
Fatty protests too much me thinks
“Today we’re gonna try something new and no I don’t mean your father”<br>I wheezed-
I understand getting pissed off by the diet industry. It mostly peddles dangerous nonsense. People sweat blood eating salads and whole grains and ‘fat free’ junk and going to the gym. They are perpetually hungry and it doesn’t work.<br>Very few people in the past got fat. Or obese. It was unusual. When I was a child in the 60’s every school had one fat kid and everyone knew who they were.<br>We should look at what we ate in those days.<br>Meat, fish and eggs were prioritised. You had to eat all the fat too. You had to eat your greens. Butter was prized. Margarine was what you ate at the end of the week when the butter ran out - unless you were rich.<br>Potatoes provided most of the carbohydrates. Potatoes, bread, pasta and rice were considered ‘fillers’ and were never the centre of the meal. <br>Biscuits, cakes and crisps were occasional treats. We only had puddings at weekends - usually a fruit pie or crumble. Pastry did not contain sugar. Milk was full fat and did not contain sugar. Fizzy drinks were an extremely rare treat - like ice cream. We were not allowed to eat between meals.<br>This is not that long ago.
You know what that first woman needs before dying horribly in her own blubber and widening sores? Fat acceptance, even liberation. That&#39;s it. Kumbaya.
Im not fat cause i eat unhealthy all the time. Im fat because i will literally EAT EVERYTHING, in High quantities sometimes. It’s hard to calorie control cause im so busy I’ll forget to count what i ate &amp; I’ve tried it a MILLION times, to calorie count or measure food, and i just cant or I’ll forget after a week of doing it, or some shit happens in my life where I lose focus I really  DONT understand portions either. I see images of healthy food in large portions, then I replicate that (using minimal oil- Yes, thats something i do control) and eat it. But still turn out fat at the end because I’ve probably consumed too much ‘healthy’ food. My portion size idea is so distorted and im trying to learn the calories of things and use nutrition references on packaged stuff. It’s hard tho.
LOL fat body but snatch chin and neck? so realistic 😆
Stop complaining ! It’s like jail and expensive ? Good let that be a lesson to them and especially they’re parents to maybe look at the food they are eating . It’s not like they were forced to get obese .
21 Senators are between the ages of 70 and 80 with 50% of the Senate being over 65. 46% of the Senate Democrats are in this age range along with 54% of the Senate Republicans. 32% of the House is 65+ with 40% of the House Democrats and 23% of House Republicans. <br><br>These are scary statistics when the median age of the American citizen is only 38.8 years old. This is a problem on both sides. <br><br>Every person of power in government, especially those in the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court should be required to have a yearly physical including a mental health screening, including a yearly mental fitness/competency test if they&#39;re over the age of 65. These results must all be made public. These also should be required before a potential candidate can enter or announce their run for office, no matter the age, but especially in instances where the candidate has had some sort of illness or injury that could affect mental capacity, such as, you know, a stroke.<br><br>Laundry list of requirements we should have, I know. But our Founding Fathers didn&#39;t have to deal with these things. People didn&#39;t live long enough to experience mental deterioration in the same way that we do today.
My father suffers from the exact same thing.  Thinks the world around him is crazy and everyone else is wrong, constantly acting as if everyone’s mad at him for no reason.
Fat shaming needs to make a strong comeback
YESSSS YOU BOUGHT YUCCA!!!!!! Lemme get my popcorn. Cannot keep my fat little fingers out of those metallics its so much LOVEEEEEEE for me!!!
Ive been obese for a decent part of my young adult life. It&#39;s scary experiencing health issues and feeling hopeless about changing my habits, yet still trying to make changes to feel better and live a healthier life. Thank you for your videos and specifically this one.
If you’re obese by choice, I shouldn’t have to pay for your healthcare.
Most people in the U.S are fat because they still think the 2000 calorie per day recommended diet still applies to modern times,<br>It was created back when the average person got a tenth the amount of calories from sugar and were far more active than people today.<br>  Even if they stick to 2000 calories (which I highly doubt)  they wonder why they don&#39;t lose weight from exercise, not understand the recommendation already includes moderate exercise.<br><br>  I also think a lot of fat people will go eat out to a place like Applebee&#39;s, and then think that what they&#39;re served is a normal portion of food to eat 2 or 3 times a day. Typically a restaurant meal is enough calories to last an entire day and then some.
I should eat only green so you can be healthy and &quot;SKINNY&quot; 💚🍏😝
Why does her family give her fatening food? I wouldn&#39;t
I dont want to sound like im thinking that im a &quot;healthy example&quot;, because im not (bmi 16, not anorexic or anything). But i never understood &quot;binge eating&quot;, like why? Also i love making my own food, if there is a way for me to make it from scratch, i will do it (for example my own pasta, or my own burger buns or just anything, i like knowing what i eat (maybe im just autistic, because i also like knowing what medicine i take, i really dont like taking some pills without knowing what is the main substance in them and how it affects my body)). The think that i believe is the most unhealth thing in my diet is that i dont have schedule for eating, i just eat when i feel hungry, sometimes (most often when im spending whole day in front of a pc (programmer)) i can get by on single sandwich per day, other times i can eat 4 course meal and still feel hungry. My favorite meals are toasts, avocado toast, toasts with &quot;skagenröra&quot; (Swedish prawn salad), or just toast with some type of cold meat and tomato with mozzarella and a bit of olive oil. Like i said i dont want say that im a &quot;healthy example&quot;, because im not, but i believe that im more healthy than most americans (sorry, dont feel ofended, i know you probably will), but i dont think that BMI is very good measurement for &quot;healty&quot;, just like i dont believe that iq is good measurement for &quot;intelligence&quot;, but whole my life i was on the skinny side. (Guy, 185cm and around 55-60kg, i never in my life were above 65kg, never had health problems caused by my diet. I dont go ty gym, but i have active lifestyle, 15,000 steps per day is little for me, love biking). @KianaDocherty what is your opinion about my lifestyle?<br><br>edit: Today im 20 years old, 185cm and 62kg. BMI of 18.1 (0% underweight)
Father did a bear service for his kids. They would love the gesture now, but not later in life
The reason the dad has to be in every video is because without the father the video will be taken down
Nobody hates fat people more than their own pancreas and livers and kidneys, etc.
You are in total deny. Also, there is not super morbidly obese.... it is obese and morbid obese.
If simple carbohydrates are not very good for a diet, does anyone know if fats like butter, milk, cheese are okay in moderation? Or would it be best to avoid them as well?
I would read the comments on Supersize vs Superskinny episodes, and be very worried about the number of people in the comments saying &quot;Anyone with an ED here?&quot; &quot;This show makes me feel better about my ED!&quot; &quot;This triggers my ED but I can&#39;t stop watching!&quot;
Marie needs some animal products… flesh and fat 😋
My biggest motivation for losing weight was actually a Halloween costume! I didn&#39;t meet my goal weight, but I did convert a lot of body fat into muscle of equal weight.
I believe fat people think that the food they eat is more satisfying and tasty than eating healthily. And eating healthily means eating food they don’t like or even find disgusting. But eating healthily IS more tasty, more fun, makes you feel better and satisfy you because you’re getting the nutrients you need. It gives you more energy to put that mental effort into choosing healthy. Work out how you can make eating healthily part of every day and eventually everything you eat. We are so lucky to have the internet that makes it easy to find healthy, tasty and quick recipes. Also have one or two easy fall-back meals for when you can’t be bothered to choose. For me that is chicken, rice and broccoli (swap out broccoli) for whatever vegetable you like if you don’t like broccoli.
The story of this country is so incredibly sad….corporations did not pave paradise and put in a parking lot, they killed the land. BTW, the turkey tail is like what we call the “Pope’s nose” on a chicken. It is mostly fat but if roasted well, it is delicious.
Fat people are funny 😅😂
It would be remiss not to inform you of the fact that 20% of fat people are metabolically healthy.  They&#39;re not metabolically sick they don&#39;t have diabetes joint problems health problems of any kind,  They will live to a normal life span without costing society anything. they&#39;re just fat.  Every time you see a fat person, there is a 20% chance that he or she is just as healthy as you.
Fats can be trans too?
I know this is 3 years late. But if she made it in baby pink it will be fly, silver is ugly
The super skinny thing it&#39;s for me hard to gain any real weight unless it&#39;s muscle no fat at all I tried the big Mac diet to gain and loss 3 pounds I&#39;m 128 now at 5,6 but that&#39;s with muscle, lowest was 113 when I got lazy n didn&#39;t work out but I ate like a horse at that, most I weighed was 139 with more muscle then I do now in my prime at 25 im 41 now , not annarexic but not that big eather ,and can&#39;t gain a damn pound of fat at all any where , I&#39;ve had trouble keeping weight ,I don&#39;t smoke I don&#39;t drink , eat a good amount ,work out i do karate and weights ,don&#39;t eat junk food hate sweets unless it fruite hard to gain for me acualy sucks cold a lot
Tammy desperately needs tough love. I can honestly say I’m thankful for the toughest moments of my life. Being left with pennies to my name &amp; a handful of clothes made me realize I need to make something of myself and be a strong, self reliant man. Being a functioning junky that was put into a hospital for a month made me realize what a useless lowlife I was and I needed to take full control &amp; responsibility of my life and actions. Tammy needs her false reality shattered, that is more loving than perpetuating her delusions which will make things worse and worse. The loving thing here is to confront her, not accommodate her sickness. If her family loved her, they’d set a better example &amp; someone take responsibility. It is no secret why she is so obese and acts this way, her parents have taught her everything they know.
My father left me but praise the Lord for the presence of my grandpa who I&#39;ve always looked up to. It made me create a standard that I would find someone who can love me unconditionally. Hehehe! So blessed, indeed!
I would&#39;ve never known you used to be obese by looking at you. Great job in losing that much weight. You look great.
I eat snacks but still not fat v:<br><br>But my body simply cannot go with large quantities even if I want to v:
I’m a fast food kid/teen. My parents never buy fruit, veg, or anything healthy and it’s caused me to become fat and gain eating problems. They force feed me junk and if I don’t eat they try and stuff me with shit. I would give anything to be in a a healthy house
I remember being at Disneyland and seeing this man feed an obviously unhungry toddler one french fry after another, all slathered in sugary ketchup.  Both parents were fat.  That poor child didn&#39;t stand a chance - he&#39;ll be obese due to the foolish choices of his parents.  That is damned near criminal behavior.
My take is &quot;fat positivity&quot; is just an extremist group that has given up on improving themselves. It is dedication and work to be healthy, but they are so incredibly insecure that they have to convince others, that are also overweight, that living this unhealthy life is more beneficial so they don&#39;t have to actually have to try work at anything. If they put as much energy in trying to convince people to stay on this path of self-destruction, imagine what they could do if they actually tried to lose the weight.
love these two women but they dont really have the average life.. missing a childs steps, well that is part of your chosen path..at home mums see that but we gave up our career to be there at all times. Traveling with children, take toys and games that engage them and be prepared to be engaged with them at all times of the journey (did this for years with my 3 traveling solo with them back and forth across the pond)..and yes breast feeding you keep some fat to produce milk.
Maybe its not that you hate fat people, but hate that fat people suffer for being fat. There&#39;s a lot of complicated emotional/brain stuff there.
I was able to lose 60 lbs since August and I feel so much better. I ate so horribly and so much. I fed myself on fast food, sugary drinks, and candy, so much candy. I got up to 250lbs.<br><br>My doctor put me on a Ketogenic diet (with lots of cruciferous vegetables and salads), while I also did intermittent fasting and I was able to lose all of that weight. I was able to get off of the heartburn medicine that I was on and I just feel overall so much healthier. Plus being able to fit into thinner clothes was an added benefit as well.<br><br>I did get quite alot of help by using Factor the meal delivery service to order the correct kind of food, but it is way healthier than fast food and is about the same if maybe cheaper than what I was spending on fast food.<br><br>My relationship with sugar and food in general has changed so much. I am no longer being dictated by food and I have so much more time than waiting in lines for fast food.<br><br>I would like to transition to cooking from scratch all of the food that I want to eat, but my current work and living situation makes that difficult, but in the future I am going to work on that as well.<br><br>I also need to build more muscle and lose more fat.
It might be cool to see a video where Tati goes through each skin care claim and why we want those products removed from our products (ie sulfate free, why don’t we want sulfate in products). Just a thought but love these new kind of video,  very informative!
High fat low carb is the best at controlling blood sugar and normalizing appetite
Mothers and fathers his to blame kid in the carribean is much healthier the parents should not have kids because they never learn anything in Life good luck

&#39;Is the chair fatphobic?&#39; is my current favourite quote ever haha
Fat girls/boys can workout but if they eat more calories than they burn... they are consuming more energy than they burn. It is simple
Looking at Ashely regretfully going &#39;I&#39;m the biggest now&#39;, while Meghan can&#39;t help but go &quot;I&#39;m still fat!&quot; shows the dynamics at play. Meghan <i>has</i> to be the center of attention, and the receiver of sympathy and praise, denying it to her &#39;friend&#39;, revealing what kind of person Meghan <i>really</i> is.
Encouraging people to be obese, and encouraging assisted suicide, are both the same thing.  Encouraging people to end everything to end pain instead of addressing that mental pain.
That father NEEDS to go serve in the military boot camp then a year of on base military operations; he would LEARN DISCIPLINE!!!
Thank you for this misinformations videos. Meat is probably what keeps them alive despite not being the best available. Fruits are full of fructose which contribute to fatty liver, they are as healthy as candy. But hey, don&#39;t let science in the way of your misinformations.
I don’t get how an overweight man is getting to walk around calling people fatties 🤦‍♂️
A lot of these fat acceptance people take half of a fact they kinda heard and run with it. Like being super lean 24/7 is unsustainable for most people because to do that you either have to be on tren or in a calorie deficit, both of which will cause health problems if continued for a long period of time. It is healthy to have some fat on you, however the healthy range is 18-30% depending on gender and genetics (some peoples bodies just work different. Though between 25 and 30% can still be healthy so long as ur eating healthy, drinking enough water and exercising enough. Clean bulks aren’t gonna cause any significant health problems). There is a point when it’s too much. Or how a lot of them say that 90% of the time dieting doesn’t work (I’ve heard eating healthy at all doesn’t work too, and that person is gonna die), which is true in reference to fad diets and changing your entire diet cold turkey. Making slow and gradual changes, finding healthy recipes you enjoy, not being super restrictive and meal prepping at least one meal every week is the key to long term success. The reason why fad diets don’t work is because the people who do them don’t understand nutrition and will just go back to eating how they used to after they’ve lost all the weight. The reason why cold turkey doesn’t work is because it leads to burnout. It’s the same reason being super restrictive doesn’t work, and on the people it does, it also borders on disordered eating and often there’s a correlation with an unhealthy relationship with food (Im not talking about athletes or something temporarily being super restrictive before like a weigh in or a show or something, Im talking about the instagram “nutritionists” who are like “you can’t eat bread, seed oil, meat, vegetables, water, milk ect.” They’re also the same ones who drink bleach because they believe it gives them health benefits. Basically the jilly juice mfs).
Thank you dear father Amen
Nah, im on skinny camps 😂
Intentional Weight Loss Doesn&#39;t work? I&#39;m an even 6 in height. <br>At 18 I was a literal skeleton with skin and weighed 165lbs, at 30 I was 242lbs and quite fat. <br>Now at 32 I am 171lbs simply by cutting excess food and walking instead of taking the car or bus. <br>These people have no accountability and blame everything on society instead of introspecting.
Gurl I had eaebuds in &quot;SKINNY&quot; 😂😅

Ok, I am in no way a fan of all of Disney&#39;s new crap, but i throughly enjoyed Elemental. It was finally an original story and there weren&#39;t any real agendas shoved in your face. The only thing I can recall like that was an off handed comment about Wade&#39;s sister and her girlfriend. The sister barely had any part in the movie other than that scene and that was it. It was a wonderful movie about wanting to hold on to family tradition while also wanting to find your own way in the world. Ember, the main character, had an extremely close relationship with her father and that was the main turmoil she was feeling because she wanted him to be proud of her. As a girl who adores her father, has a great relationship with him, and wants to make him proud, I greatly relate to that. And the romance aspect between Ember and Wade felt like a completely traditional &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; plot. Stereotypes and assumptions about people who are different keep two lovers apart, only for their love to bring everyone together and improve the lives of those around them. It was an incredibly wholesome movie, moved me to tears multiple times, and even my extremely masculine, cop boyfriend thought it was great. I think Elemental deserves a shot because I was actually impressed by Disney with that movie.
U guys did fight the lions , tigers and bears. And i know why even if you havent realized yet (PLEASE PAY ATTENTION)  cause to most people its the same reason that we picked the berry&#39;s as well as carried and nurtured ,struggled,in pain( and i know men know pain as much or so.

( Thank you for going through it by our side also i know its hard for you as well.) BUT most of you that are in the delivery room well we are having our battles ,Cant even handle the pressure .A lot of you faint or have a panic attack ect.  so when a man has the balls to take that long journey happily and especially more then once  (after knowing the experience of it ) and still love / care and sacrifices to build a family to love for the man they love and obviously feel they are worthy enough to deserve the blessing god gave us both . who did most the development ..<br><br><br>######<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23we">#We</a> know and stick to the plan in our development. 9 months in advance.

Let me remind you lot of you guys fainted cried and threw up while we were doin our part of the job but you guys are STONG...####<br><br><b>*****There is NO CRYING IN BASEBALL**</b><br><br> And thats just the beginning of so much to come (on one knows til they are there ) and no matter how old 2/13/18/25/42 you kids are they are your kids even if you were so luckey to be there when your kids them self are parents/grandparents , you realize it starts over again. The worry the hope the struggle the happiness the sadness and at one point or another we all mess up no one is perfect  we all wished we would of tryed harder been there more failed ...<br>The only thing we can do is try to make sure the people you love know the love never ends <br><br>I think that&#39;s why Men fight the lions proving his appreciation of his women, gratefulness to God our FATHER and deservingness of this LIFE he blessed upon us= Love  ...<br>Cause  believe me just cause you seen not the animals with names there are no words for we fought for you .

People everyday everywhere thinking they know something they never take the time to understand EVERYONE DESERVES LOVE/LIFE APPRECIATE THE BLESSING&#39;S HE GAVE US...
Tammy has done nothing but gain weight over the course of the show and it showed through her sheer laziness, narcissism and absolute lack of self awareness. Shit her body has literally gone to the final resort of storing excess fat in her forehead of all places. <br><br>Amy on the other hand along with her and Tammy&#39;s brother put everything aside to go through with their journeys and complete them and they took full responsibility when thr screwed up.
America is not the most obese country in the world because America is not a fucking country.
I am a med student and we study so much about how obesity is a risk factor for numerous diseases, focusing on mechanisms of how being obese specifically affect different organ system. I cannot fathom how this person is a doctor and still chose to overlook all that researched information?

Ego vs intuition basically. Discipline the ego, basically what answer every religion and philosophist came too. I&#39;m glad people are noticing spirituality and such more, just sad people are only now realizing it to come too the surface. People needing guidance, remember, lots of answer within meditation, eating healthy, anything that would heighten the intuition, not the ego. There&#39;s a reason christianity says we go to hell for indulging in cravings, murder and so on. But read it more metaphorically, the ego gets stronger whenever we feed it, the ego then suffers more, reason why they use the term &quot;hell&quot;, if people read everything metaphorically you&#39;ll notice a lot of religions/way of life, like buddhism, hinduism, christianity, etc... they were all talking about higher cosnciousness, basically feeding the intuition instead/disciplining the ego. We knew it for 1000&#39;s of years, most people just take religion too literally, but really, there&#39;s a lot to learn about how the psychè and ego works in mostly hinduism and buddhism. Christianity has been changed a lot for propaganda purposes, but the old testament teaches more about it. The new one is a bit more materialistic, reason why some christians these days are waay too Karen. <br><br>Anyway, if you don&#39;t feel like reading any religion you could also check out Carl Jung, he talks a lot about shadow work and founded analytical psychology. He&#39;s also the one who studied the unconscious state and so fourth, like the four archetypes like the Self, the Persona, the Shadow and the Anima/Animus. The shadow being everything about yourself you don&#39;t see as positive, and the anima/animus which is the masculine and feminine side. Anima is the man&#39;s internal other, the feminine. Animus on the other hand is a woman&#39;s internal other, the masculine. Balancing both can help you in creating stability, like courage and on the other side empathy. Lots of people these days are unbalanced, either too fragile or too aggressive. Lots of it can stem from parents splitting up, not having a father/mother figure, it can also stem from lots of processed food, which is known to decrease testosterone in men, not sure about women. Aggressiveness can also stem from too huge of a ego, something that alcohol increases, which is why so many are depressed when drinking. It all connects, there&#39;s a reason why religion looks down on alcohol and such. Psychedelics work the other way, diminishing the ego, helps you see the world clearer without the emotional fog and so on. A reason why psychedelics have helped so many people with addiction, the ego is what is addicted, psychedelics also rewrites thought patterns, making it easier to write healthy new one. Philosophy and religion always knew about it, christianity may just have muddied the whole picture of what religion is, hinduism and buddhism teaches about you, how to overcome your mind/ego and live a happy life, all based on psychology and spirituality. What people get wrong is that spirituality is about believing something that isn&#39;t real. Yes, christianity says this, but spirituality is about reaching your higher self, disciplining your ego and showing love and empathy, which is all what the intuition is about. Sure, religion can be stories, but hinduism and buddhism is a way of life, yes, it does have stories, but most read it literally, and metaphorically. Example, the gods in hinduism all tells a story, the gods are based on love, death, ego and so fourth. Reading through the lines will make you understand the &quot;gods&quot; are just metaphors for the different emotions you have, the stories deepening your understanding of these emotions. <br><br>I&#39;m not religious, I was an atheist but now a theist. I&#39;ve studied all of them and see similarities in all of them, so I see how every religion can help you. I do believe every &quot;God&quot; people have seen has been under the influence of psychedelics though, and that every God is the same entity, just people having different viewpoints on what a higher power should look like. Are you christian and take mushrooms, well, you might as well see Jesus or something. I&#39;m saying besides the &quot;Gods&quot; there are actual knowledge to living a better life. I do believe there&#39;s something higher, but what, I don&#39;t know, all i know is that people has known how to live a spiritual happy life centuries ago, so there must be something giving them the knowledge. People have been known to have psychedelic experiences where they&#39;ve been shown what happiness is and how to live by it. Easily said, the ego is what suffers. Enjoy the little things, have a positive life but also a disciplined one, comfort is what ruins us. This was really long, but yeah, it&#39;s all my knowledge though the years connecting psychology, psychedelics and religion/spirituality.<br><br>Being uncomfortable also increases dopamine and other chemicals like norepinephrine, which is why people do yoga, ice baths, meditation on spike mats and feel way better afterwards. <br><br>You should check out channels like Sky Life, Seek Discomfort and Yes Theory, they all got different examples of exposing yourself to uncomfortable things :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=4m45s">4:45</a> in all fairness that statistic isn&#39;t really a comparison. one thing to credit the USA on there is the honesty of the statistic, when they say you&#39;re obese you are ACTUALLY obese. UK it not the same, most people branded &quot;Obese&quot; are above average weight at best. <br><br>I&#39;m a 5&#39;10, male - weighing at 15.4 stone(215.6 pounds?) and I&#39;m considered obese... When reality is im actually quite average in size. I fit most medium size clothing which at ideal weight(in with the UK claims is 12 stone- 168pound- at max) will still be my clothing fit.
Look I’m clinically obese and everyday I workout and eat right and I’m dropping weight like it’s no one’s business. I say that first…what the hell is wrong with these women they are so obese they don’t even resemble normal human form face or otherwise. Dear god how can you let yourself get that far? I’ve got 60 lbs to lose but Jesus my knees look like knees and my face has a clear chin and neck!! Wtf?!
Al bundy once said &quot;beautiful women makes us guys want to buy beer, ugly women makes us want to DRINK beer&quot;  and i must now add fake woman makes us want to throw beer. 🤣🤣
&quot;You ARE erasing a potentially fat body.&quot; GOOD!!! 😂 HOW is me going from 200 to 122 a HORRIBLE and non-&quot;positive&quot; thing?! 😱 My step brother died of obesity this spring, not making it to 50. I have smoked half pack for 28 years and out-lived him.
Black, brown, white, fat, skinny, tall, short, rich, poor, male, female!! We are all the same underneath, we all feel shame, which is beyond ridiculous. But thank god for some of the stronger beautiful successful people who have put themselves out into the light and helped us feel that maybe, just maybe, someone will believe that is was not our fault. Tears fall as I write this and I feel so much respect and love for you beautiful woman. Thank you thank you, let us all remember our humanity. Hold on to your kind hearts ♥️
Clearly Pacific islanders have a genetic predisposition to obesity.  Even 50 years ago, these people were FAT.
This show is brilliant because it exposes a single grand truth about fat people that no one talks about: THEY LIE.
HAHAHA.  After seeing the fat women, the host looks extra skinny.  Good contrast.
it has taken me like 3 days to finish a bag of sun chips.....what the fuck. how does tammy eat 32 meals in 2 days ? i know the meals they likely got. its called Swanson delivery. not bad if youre an older person with self care struggles. my grandmother would get them. its like better tv dinners kinda , the ice creams were really good. but yeah , those are very normal sized portions. honestly on the big side if you get the family plan meals because they expect you to share. if they got 32 meals , that was likely the family plan for about a month. because yes they can do every meal , you can choose like all dinner stuff all breakfast stuff. but they are a whole family so lets play it safe and assume they only got 32 family dinners. we are talking little plates of salbury steaks, serves about 5 people and usually comes with some sort of veggie or side. SHE LITERALLY ATE SO MUCH FOOD , SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COOK 32 FROZEN MEALS IN 2 DAYS. HER FAT ASS WILL GET UP TO EAT BUT WONT GET UP TO WASH HER OWN ASS ? this is why i hate her. the effort she will put in to being a lazy fuck is insane. my grandmother died on top of me , my father and step mother are pedophiles i was abused by , ive been raped during a home invasion where i was later blamed for being raped at 14 years old. like , tammy having buck teeth and being slightly retarded is not an excuse to be this fat. my husband is one of if not the only person i have ever met to be kind to me in a real human way. i met him when i was 18. i had nothing and no one, i was homeless. oh but tammy please tell me how your fat worthless ass is oh so sad cause mommy is a red neck inbred cockroach lover that doesnt love you. fuck i hate her
YESSSS YOU BOUGHT YUCCA!!!!!! Lemme get my popcorn. Cannot keep my fat little fingers out of those metallics its so much LOVEEEEEEE for me!!!
Serena is a big ugly bitch and shes also very annoying and rude idgaf if she is good at throwing balls. Ashley is a fatass who has no talent at all. can a fat man become famous/rich by pretending to be a model? Hell naw
1 cookie will NEVER make anyone fat. A conveyor belt of anything will.
It was very nice to watch how Jason talk about his fatherhood experience. I wish more man have the same understanding of importance about the time they spend with their children.
I want to not have to make all my clothes because I&#39;m too big for straight sizes but too skinny for plus sizes. So losing just 15 pounds would put me back into the straight sizes.
Maybe its not that you hate fat people, but hate that fat people suffer for being fat. There&#39;s a lot of complicated emotional/brain stuff there.
It&#39;s really ironic that fat acceptance folks get up in arms and want to censor medical terms like &quot;obesity,&quot; but are perfectly fine with calling people &quot;infinifat&quot; and &quot;death fat&quot; which are not medical terms and sound so much more insulting than the medical terminology. Just goes to show how batshit insane this movement is.
I&#39;m a binge eater. I&#39;m part of the lucky group who binges but doesn&#39;t gain weight. It&#39;s late at night so I&#39; feeling stupid enoigh to tell this story. Sorry if yoi read this. I know I have a problem, but my family doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m a teenager, so when I&#39;m binging they just think &#39;oh, great, no anorexia&#39; and when I&#39;m restricting, well, they saw me eating a lot the day before so it&#39;s just &#39;using calories wisely&#39; or &#39;just not hungry&#39;. I restrict enpigh to pffset the binges, that&#39;s why I&#39;m not fat. But they won&#39;t let me fix the problem. I know variety triggers me like nothing else. I know the thought &#39;I should spoce this up&#39; will make me eat everything in sight. I knoe not sticling to the plans I&#39;ve made will cause me to feel like I will never have any control over food. But they shove the wrong londs of food in my mouth anyway. I don&#39;t want to be stick thin, but I want to enjoy my food. And if that meams counting the number of chews I tale before I swallow, that&#39;s fine with me. This is just me ranting about my parents in a hotel late at night. Again, sorry.
As a current skinny-fat person making progress in weight and fat loss, I don’t care how self aware yet unhealthy these people get, I will always feel bad for them. I wouldn’t say that I can see myself in them, because I’ve always been able to control myself to at least one piece of candy a day. It’s just, I understand their struggle which just reminds me that I’ve had that mindset before
Good fats and salt are not the problem.
The real issue here is the amount of airtime we give them. These uppity fat f**ks are all going to die early and if we just ignore their ridiculous and delusional rants they won&#39;t exist fr much longer. And let&#39;s be real... Has the BP movement achieved anything at all? Not really. People aren&#39;t lining up to &#39;get fat&#39; so they can join this amazing collective of stunning and brave land whales. <br><br>Health and strength is the goal. Let the fatsos rant. They&#39;ll be gone soon.
I almost never eat breakfast. I don&#39;t have time to eat much for lunch so dinner is the only decent size meal I get. I&#39;m a number of years younger than her and grew up with skinny being very important in the 90&#39;s and early 00&#39;s but I still prefer to be skinny now. As skinny as I can with age and less activity. Lack of the feeling of hunger also makes my eating disordered. I certainly fast intermittently. It wasn&#39;t when I wasn&#39;t just cooking for myself. I eat fairly healthy but I don&#39;t deny myself food either. I do think that my body pain would be helped by eating an anti-inflammatory diet but I can&#39;t eat a super strict diet either. It&#39;s too time consuming and complicated.
it’s not a movie about being FAT
The name is a bit off putting, but I actually like the show. I do like that in general they try to avoid super skinny people that would be unfit for the show, like folks who have anorexia and who need deeper therapeutic help to eat more.
&#39;&#39;hey fatty&#39;&#39; no shot, i spilled my coffee laughing 😂😂
It might be more useful to discuss the hormonal and bilogical components of weight gain. The focus on obesity, is a focus on the aesthetic. If health is what you care about, discuss health. There is a subtle but important distinction. As a person who was fat and lost weight... people gave no fucks about my health when i was fat and when i lost weight. I simple became easier on the eyes and that&#39;s all that mattered. Also, your thumbnails of excessively obese people can read as dehumanization and a caricature of a community you are trying to help. Just think maybe about if yourtarget audience, leaves your channel feeling shamed or empowered. (not to say they don&#39;t) great well researched content! I&#39;d love to even see some content about insulin resistance, pcos, etc etc etc since many of those factors affect &quot;obesity&quot;. The other part of this is.... i recommend some class analysis, race analysis even. Making obesity an individual and behavioral issue... screams that perhaps, you could be missing something important.
Big girl here, wouldn’t wear anything more than a bikini for swimming, because fat girl swimsuits are made for beach wales.  They put far too much cloth to look modest, but all that material ain’t comfortable for swimming and definitely not staying indefinitely wet in. Women who wear something like that typically won’t take a splash of water.
There are very differing opinions in carnivorous communities about who agrees or does not agree with Paul Saladino. One diet is not for all, Paul works out a lot, if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t need the same diet as him. <br><br>Yes, we ate a few plants. That&#39;s logical because if the hunt didn&#39;t succeed or went wrong or our meat storage was empty in winter times we did need the ability to eat plants of some sort. Just not any of the plants found in the grocery store today; we have developed them ourselves. Made them bigger and sweeter. <br><br>At the end the fact remains: fat and glucose are fuel, so choose one of them. Mixing them is detrimental for health and that is the real problem with an omnivore diet.
I&#39;m a Greek Orthodox Christian. Firstly, I&#39;ll try to explain why Orthodoxy is the only True/Correct faith. Secondly, I&#39;ll suggest some things that could help anyone who is interested in Orthodoxy.<br><br><br><br>For the first part: <br><br>Orthodoxy is the First, Original (Historically) and only True faith which is the outcome of the direct revelation by God Himself (the Ιncarnated Word of God = Jesus Christ -&gt; Bible) and thus is not a relegion (religion=a man-made belief system which is trying to explain God, as all known religions (Islam,Hinduism,....) or Christian heresies (Protestantism, Catholicism,...) are. Hence, Orthodoxy is not a gesture of men reaching God, but is a gesture of God revealing himself to men) <br><br>Also, is called &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; which in Greek (The language in which the Bible was written by the Apostles originally) means the correct(Ortho=Ορθός=correct) belief(doxy=Δοξασία/Δόξα=belief/faith/dogma/tenet) and is the faith of all Greeks (to which Jesus=God said:<br>(John 12:20-24): &quot; ²⁰Some Greeks had gone to Jerusalem to worship during Passover. ²¹Philip from Bethsaida in Galilee was there too. So they went to him and said, “Sir, we would like to meet Jesus.” ²²Philip told Andrew. Then the two of them went to Jesus and told him.<br>²³Jesus said: The time has come for the Son of Man to be given his glory.<br>²⁴I tell you for certain that a grain of wheat that falls on the ground will never be more than one grain unless it dies. But if it dies, it will produce lots of wheat&quot;) <br><br>Prophesying that the time has come for Him (Son of Man = Jesus as 100% human as the son of Virgin Mary/Theotokos) to die on the cross (...grain of wheat...it dies) and then given His Glory (Jesus as 100% God) after His Resurrection and Ascension to the right hand of God. Also Prophesying that His death &quot;will produce lots of wheat&quot;, which is linked to Greeks stating that Greeks (and also all other people which are not Jewish and follow the same path (as Greeks in that time symbolized all non Jews), will glorify Jesus by recognizing Him as their Messiah, Savior and true God and they will keep the True and Correct Faith (Orthodoxy), and they will not go astray (as the Heretics or other religions), and In this way they will participate in the &quot;production of lots of wheat&quot;, (In contrast to Jews and other Heretics (Catholics, etc which will do go astray and so they won&#39;t be able to inherit God&#39;s Kingdom and be Gods by grace)) <br><br>(Jesus was always, before and after His death and always, simultaneously 100% human and 100% God. At first as 100% God He took the human nature by His gestation in Virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit and became simultaneously 100% human too. Then by His tortures and the death of His human nature on the cross He took upon Himslef the sin of the entire fallen human nature and put an end to it with the death of this fallen nature of humans which didn&#39;t had the ability of Theosis (Theosis=To become God not by nature but by grace), but was the outcome of spiritual death and sin (see Genesis in the old Testament and the fall of Adam and Eve). Finally, with His Resurrection and Ascension (As 100% human and 100% God simultaneously) to the right hand of God (The Father, and also with the Holy Spirit to Which He was fully connected to both of them always as the second Person of Holy Trinity by his 100% God nature), He led the human nature to the ABILITY of Theosis and the inheritance of God&#39;s Kingdom making humans who manage to go to Heaven the same as Him (by grace not by their nature)=Gods by grace. <br><br>But there is a big misconception in some heresies: God didn&#39;t Ιncarnated, became human and died on the cross to put everyone who says that believes in Jesus in heaven. Instead He did all that to give to people the ABILITY of Theosis and the inheritance of God&#39;s Kingdom. Whether this ABILITY is reclaimed and a person is saved and not go to hell, depends on the person&#39;s FREE WILL, (and what they truly believe in their heart), which is expressed by their actions in their lives on earth, the acceptance of God&#39;s Truth by becoming members of His one True Church by Being Orthodox Baptized (Other heretic baptisms as Catholic, etc are invalid even if some orthodox priests who are in places where Orthodoxy isn&#39;t very common say otherwise) and Chrismated (also this two things are necessary in order to be able to commune with the Holy Spirit and then Jesus Christ and Actually see God Himself and his Uncreated Light from this Life on earth) and having a correct lifestyle which includes Gods commands and participation in the liturgical mysteries, and having a spiritual father for guidance. This belief that everyone will be saved just because they say they are Christians is wrong, it was made just because it&#39;s suits people as the easy path and this is a typical example of why all these diefferent heresies were created. <br><br>All known religions are either man-made paganistic phylosophies (Hinduism,....), or heretic ideologies (Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam,...) (influenced by the Revelation of God by God Himself=Orthodoxy---historically precedes all its heresies and islam too which is influenced by Orthodoxy too anyway) where the truth is changed, falsified, misquoted and manipulated in order to conform to the sinful prejudices and to the enforcement of authority of the different people that made them (Pope, Mohammed,....). The belief that every belief is true and correct as long as someone refers to the word Jesus is wrong, the truth and Gods&#39; presence and grace is only in Orthodoxy. People don&#39;t know this things and  continue to be misleaded from generation to generation. <br><br>Also, an other proof is the miracle of the Holy Light at the day of the celebration of Resurrection in Easter which always is done by the Orthodox Patriarch until today, and one time in history (In 1549 AD) when the heretics didn&#39;t let the Orthodox Patriarch perform the miracle and tried to do it by themselves, the miracle didn&#39;t happen and the pillar next to the Orthodox Patriarch opened and the Holy Light came out illuminating only his candles. The Emir watched the events from the minaret of the mosque opposite the Temple and shouted &quot;One is the true God, the God of Christians. I believe in the Risen Christ&quot;, Then the Muslims caught him and beheaded him. His holy relic is kept to this day in the Holy Monastery of the Great Virgin of Jerusalem. The crack of the pillar located in the middle column to the left of the entrance to the complex of the Holy Sepulcher is 1.20 meters high and, it looks like a rising flame. From then on Heretics gave back to the Orthodox Bishop the right to do the miracle himself. <br><br>THE BIGGEST PROOF IS THAT IN ALL THIS RELIGIONS PEOPLE CAN NOT SEE GOD, BUT IN ORTHODOXY GOD CAN BE SEEN DIRECTLY, EXPERIENCED WITH ALL SENSES, EATEN AND DRUNK UNITING DIRECTLY WITH A BAPTIZED PERSON&#39;S HEART (BY THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY EUCHARIST) AND A PERSONAL EXISTENCIAL RELATIONSHIP AND COMMUNICATION WITH GOD, THEOSIS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF HEAVEN AND GODS KINGDOM CAN BE ACHIVED BY THIS LIFE ON EARTH AS THE MAIN ELEMENT OF ORTHODOXY.<br><br><br><br>For the second part, some things that could help are: <br><br>The Channel &quot;trisagion films&quot; which has videos about Orthodoxy and lives of saints in English and the movie of &quot;the life of saint Joseph the hesychast&quot; which is available in English in youtube. <br><br>Byzantine Music and hymns. <br><br>The book &quot;Great Gerontikon&quot; and the lives of saints. <br><br>Elder Ephraims of Arizona monasteries throughout US (who is most probably to officially declared a saint in recent future). <br><br>Holy mountain of Athos and Vatopedi monastery and its youtube Channel.  <br><br>Pray to God by your own words or with known Orthodox prayers, as much as you can, in order to start feeling the grace inside your heart. <br><br>LEARN ABOUT THE &quot;UNCEASING PRAYER OF THE MIND AND HEART&quot; (&quot;JESUS PRAYER&quot;).<br><br><br>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: <br><br>Find a spiritual father for guidance <br><br>Start having a correct lifestyle which includes Gods commands, and learn as much as you can by studying. <br><br>Participate in the liturgical mysteries of the church. <br><br>When you feel ready be Orthodox Baptized (Other heretic baptisms as Catholic, etc are invalid, even if some wrongly say the opposite) and Chrismated (2 things necessary to be able to commune with God and see God Himself and his Uncreated Light from this Life on earth and achieve Theosis, and for later to be able to inherit God&#39;s Kingdom). <br><br>THE ONLY PURPOSE OF ALL THOSE THINGS IS TO HELP A PERSON ACHIVE COMPLETE COMMUNION (PERSONAL EXISTENCIAL RELATIONSHIP THAT HAPPENS WITH ALL OUR BEING-BODY AND SOUL) WITH GOD, THEOSIS (AS AN OUTCOME OF THE FORMER) AND THE EXPERIENCE AND INHERITANCE OF HEAVEN AND GODS KINGDOM (=GOD&#39;S PRESENCE), FIRST FROM THIS LIFE AND THEN FOR ETERNITY IN THE OTHER LIFE, BY SACRIFICING THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVE/CAN PRODUCE BY OUR SELVES WHICH IS OUR FREE WILL (AS A GOD GIVEN ABILITY...EVERY OTHER THING EITHER COMES FROM THE GRACE OF GOD/HIS PRESENCE OR THE ABSENCE OF THE GRACE OF GOD/HIS ABSENCE...) (FREE WILL = THE ABILITY TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN US...WE ARE LIKE A MECHANICAL MACHINE,  WE CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS (THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE THINGS GOD HIMSELF DOES...IF GOOD..., AS WE ARE IMAGES OF GOD--AND THIS ONLY BECAUSE GOD CREATED US THAT WAY) BUT ONLY IF WE HAVE THE NECESSARY FUEL IN US WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THE GRACE OF GOD (IF WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT GOOD THINGS), OR THE ABSENCE OF THE GRACE OF GOD (IF WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT BAD THINGS...THERE IS NO EMPTY SPACE IN THE SPIRITUAL WORD, BUT THE &quot;EMPTY SPACE&quot; OF THE ABSENCE OF GOD IS &quot;FILLED&quot; WITH THE OPPOSITE TRAITS OF GOD WHICH ARE THE EVIL THINGS...). <br><br>EVERY GOOD THING IS A RAY OF LIGHT OF GOD&#39;S INFINITE UNCREATED LIGHT AND EVERY BAD THING IS AN ABSENCE OF A RAY OF LIGHT OF GOD&#39;S INFINITE UNCREATED LIGHT.
&quot;They would rather we remain addicted to medication our entire lives than be fat&quot; Why is this a binary choice you can not be fat and not be addicted to medication this is so disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. Its called poisoning the well and false equivalency. In fact everything she said there was the same all logical fallacies.
Your exactly correct, in the sixties growing up in Australia with a white Christian majority is worlds away from the white Christian minority of today,  we have youth crime running rampant,  men dressed up as women,  men competing in women&#39;s sport, drag queens educating our children,  Islamic terrorism in all our major cities,  drug addiction,  fatherless children, obesity rates going through the roof, antisocial behaviour celebrated on time tok, we have no identity whatsoever due to the massive immigration from all the violent people in the planet
Tween sister...the Bad and the ugly
My wife is a mini version of this. Shes 5&#39; 4&quot; 200 lbs but she only looks fat because she has big boobs, she only has a double chin because of her small jaw, she only weighs so much because she&#39;s always been &quot;solid&quot;, her mom told her so, she only looks fat in the picture because it was a bad angle. And every year the weight goes up.
What does idiot and know that God is often referred to as father.  My father, who’s thout in heaven.<br>I am a father and the last time I checked I do have a penis. Therefore God has a penis.
Fat phobia? It is about health. Making excuses for people who are overweight does not help them. Why someone is overweight has a lot of different issues like people. They don&#39;t need activists, they need assistance.
Tween sister...the Bad and the ugly
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
Not sure where this falls in the whole self-deception or secret eating category, but I have trouble losing weight due to psych issues. I had a complete mental breakdown and lost a ton of weight. An unhealthy amount, in fact. I had to be forced to eat. Now that I’ve recovered, I’m obese. Every time I try to lose weight and start seeing results, I self sabotage because being thin, in my mind, equates to being “sick.” I haven’t managed to break through that psychological barrier, yet. No obese-related health scare has hit hard enough to overpower that initial belief.
Sexy fat breast
Great job on mentioning and noticing how reality TV often isn&#39;t reality. I think if more people understood this then Trump would never have been elected president. An example from super size versus super skinny, Jillian McKief I walks down the street and yells at people about their fat bums and people just keep on walking. Several people commented they would have just turned around and confronted her. I think what they don&#39;t understand is that it&#39;s more than likely that those &quot;pedestrians&quot; were recruited, paid a fee. and instructed to ignore her. Also reality show producers, very often stage scenes and have scripts.  I learned a lot about this when I used to watch the 24/7 big brother feed, and compare it to what was shown ( and not shown) on television. Also people behaving badly is what viewers want to see; it&#39;s what sells advertising. The producers will do anything in their power to create conflict that they can film. If Tammy&#39;s story arc this season is how annoying and what a bad person she is, the producers are not going to show any footage where she was not showing that behavior.
The only people mad at that line are actual skinny bitches. Women like that don&#39;t like us real curvy girls go talk about it so fuck it !
I’m fat because of Obama
Hey Kiana... did you know that EVERY SINGLE ONE of your videos AND every one of the &quot;Supersize and Superskinny&quot; videos  I watched over the last 5 days had a Wendy&#39;s commercial in it? E-V-E-R-Y S-I-N-G-L-E one. Even for a corrupt outfit like YouTube, that&#39;s pretty sad...
When i lived in San Francisco i learned to make Chinese home style food which is low in fat and high in healthy vegetables.  I don&#39;t understand why so called Chinese restaurants drowned the food in grease and sodium which ruins the taste for me.  I will stick to my trusty wok as my meals are fast and healthy
I had a friend who lost a significant amount of weight. Despite how much I wanted to lose weight, but failing miserably though now I&#39;m down 70 pounds and just a little more to go, I only felt happy for her. While I do wish to be skinny and what not, I just can&#39;t see myself getting upset at someone for putting the work into getting fit. I also want bigger breast but I don&#39;t hate my friends who have a bigger chest than me. I think it also comes down to maturity levels as well. I can&#39;t see a mature person getting that angry and jealous over someone else&#39;s success. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s just what I think. Just because I hate my body and self, doesn&#39;t mean that I wouldn&#39;t want someone else to stay unhealthy either. That&#39;s just weird. I took my issue and turned it into motivation to try to get me to lose weight. I just want to finally feel pretty, or at least don&#39;t feel like a whale. I probably will always feel that way but still. That and I want to find a man who will love me, even though I know it&#39;s a far fetched fantasy. It&#39;s so far beyond fantasy that it&#39;s not even in the realm of any world.

fun fact amy is even slimmer now but tammy is still very obese
At first I felt sad like I was gonna be permanently messed up because I had a terrible father. But then when I saw Brett&#39;s comment at the end I felt so much better because she turned out so great despite whatever issue there was. That gives me hope
As a current skinny-fat person making progress in weight and fat loss, I don’t care how self aware yet unhealthy these people get, I will always feel bad for them. I wouldn’t say that I can see myself in them, because I’ve always been able to control myself to at least one piece of candy a day. It’s just, I understand their struggle which just reminds me that I’ve had that mindset before
Former binge eater myself, I beat this disease almost a decade ago and became a competitive cyclist. I came across your channel by accident a few days ago, and, Kiana, I can’t stop watching! Holy shit I had no idea I needed this type of content! I had no clue mukbang or fat activism even existed to this extent. I’m well aware of all the science you’re highlighting throughout your videos, but the delivery is so entertaining, I watched almost every video. Keep it up 👏
I&#39;m suprised the genetic component of longevity is so low. <br><br>My great grandma lived to be 108 years old, and died shortly before her 109th birthday. My great uncle was in his 90s when he was still running around the yard, playing ultimate Frisbee with the kids! <br><br>My father&#39;s side of the family tend to live very long, but they don&#39;t necessarily live a healthy lifestyle. Not an unhealthy one, but nothing particularly healthy either.
Such exaggeration that fat people  cancelled Abercrombie it was in bad state after the great recession in 2008. As it was to expensive for the average teenager or young person.Bud light is a somewhat modern comparison.
They need to get that doctor down in Texas that yells at them fat bodies. He’s just brutal…🤠

I’m an obese 12 year old girl and it’s so difficult to live 😔 my obesity makes me feel depressed, unloved and (very very much) a financial burden to my mom
freddy was doing the most to keep her fat even like taking the fall for her on lies<br>you think he might have a feeder fetish?
I understand getting pissed off by the diet industry. It mostly peddles dangerous nonsense. People sweat blood eating salads and whole grains and ‘fat free’ junk and going to the gym. They are perpetually hungry and it doesn’t work.<br>Very few people in the past got fat. Or obese. It was unusual. When I was a child in the 60’s every school had one fat kid and everyone knew who they were.<br>We should look at what we ate in those days.<br>Meat, fish and eggs were prioritised. You had to eat all the fat too. You had to eat your greens. Butter was prized. Margarine was what you ate at the end of the week when the butter ran out - unless you were rich.<br>Potatoes provided most of the carbohydrates. Potatoes, bread, pasta and rice were considered ‘fillers’ and were never the centre of the meal. <br>Biscuits, cakes and crisps were occasional treats. We only had puddings at weekends - usually a fruit pie or crumble. Pastry did not contain sugar. Milk was full fat and did not contain sugar. Fizzy drinks were an extremely rare treat - like ice cream. We were not allowed to eat between meals.<br>This is not that long ago.
Today I discovered your channel and I totally love it. A joke popped into my mind while listening to you - Yo momma is so fat I am genuinely concerned about her 😅 😂 Thanks for all the great advice ❤️
As someone that used to be obese when I was younger, I feel the  &quot;junkfood&quot;  effect  just hearing the word TLC . And I could get &quot;psychological diabetes&quot; if I watch too much of it. So thank you for balancing it out with some healthy insight!
I loved it. and if you think the movie was about making fun of a fat man, you clearly missed the point. You probably never have wathed a Darren Aaronovsky film before. The move wasnt about a fat guy, but his redemption. Its a redemption story.
Mustard greens help you lose stomach fat and helps your Core !
This is why whenever I feel heavy and wanna loose the extra fat I eat my local food once a day and then eat fruits for the rest of the day to replace my cravings for sugary snacks and it works like magic and I feel good and lighter too.
sO yOu tHiNk iM sKiNny got me laughing so hard😂😂
The presenter himself used to be obese and so was his family. He went through a lot of abuse and worked hard to be fit and healthy.
There is a similar docu/reality series as 600 lb life of british origin called Fat doctor.Some episodes of it is on You Tube. That series not as intrusive to the people recieving the surgery but they are interviewed in depth and one can notice they have already done some amount of mental and intellectual scrutinizing about their weight as to the when, why and whats around their weight. And they also interview the doctors more and also show more of the medical procedure as such, which some perhaps may find &quot;gory&quot; in some of the episodes where it&#39;s not blurred out but to some it might be worth to see the fat aprons they need to get by to get to the stomach pouch covering but put burden on the organs. This especially since some Fat Tokers try to argue that visceral doesn&#39;t exist (but even skinny people can have it).
They seem quite miserable for a &quot;fat and happy&quot; person. I think that it&#39;s just as much about how they feel about living in their own body as it is about societal influence. Carrying around a large amount of excessive weight has a lot of physical consequences that make life harder. I&#39;d be miserable too. It&#39;s sad to see that this person was aware of the truth and saw they needed to make some changes...but then the FA crowd convinced them that helping yourself is &quot;oppressive&quot;. <br><br>And claims that the world would rather fat people &quot;die&quot; than remain fat makes no sense...if that were generally true, everyone would be greatly discouraging them from losing weight and bettering their health. That&#39;s something I only see within the FA crowd, itself.
It looks like he identifies as trans fat.
It&#39;s always the ugly guys who want to judge everyone else&#39;s looks and women for being overweight
You’ll call her out on her delusions about fat acceptance, but are perfectly fine with playing into her “they/them” BS? 🤔
Starts talking about fat people, fitness ad cuts in
😂 and they say American&#39;s are fat
&quot;about 25 pills a day&quot; I&#39;m on 3 meds + voluntary supplements and think that&#39;s a lot...but I&#39;m also 20 and a healthy weight. I do have a lot of issues with food, especially sugar addiction and binge eating, and if I hadn&#39;t lost about 60 lbs due to anorexia during the pandemic I&#39;d be obese rn. I&#39;m trying to improve, and I&#39;m making baby steps, but it&#39;s so hard... I never give up tho, that&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever done.<br>my pills are for my mental health (depression and adhd), so at least having to take them isn&#39;t a guilty thing, unlike food is for me 😅
I found The Mayo Clinic Diabetes Diet book by Donald D. Hensrud in April of 2021 and this is the best diet I have ever encountered.  It is not a low carb diet and it is so easy to follow.  It recommends eating a serving of fruit with every meal and having nonstarchy vegetables with meals. It has you measure your protein, carbs and fat (very low fat) with your meals and tells you how many to have each day based on how many calories a day you want to eat.  I love this diet and have successfully lost weight and kept the majority of the weight off.  I was miserable trying to follow a low carb diet in the past and had no idea I could be so happy following The Mayo Clinic Diabetes Diet.
Always we have options and choices,  do not blame food companies, do not buy and don&#39;t eat, if we r fat it us over fault.
Judging by today&#39;s society I&#39;d be surprised if fat camp isn&#39;t changed to something like &quot;fitness camp&quot; or &quot;gym camp&quot; or something less insulting
U guys did fight the lions , tigers and bears. And i know why even if you havent realized yet (PLEASE PAY ATTENTION)  cause to most people its the same reason that we picked the berry&#39;s as well as carried and nurtured ,struggled,in pain( and i know men know pain as much or so.

Hey im a pediatrician in another country and your videos helped me out very much. Aside from strictly ‘medical’ advice, talking about eating habits for obese kids and parents often end up being vague or too general. Your videos actually helped me address patients better. Thank you😊
This show was usually aired in January, like all the other weight loss shows (fat families, biggest loser etc) to take advantage of people and their new year resolutions.<br>If you need to wait for a certain date to make a change guys, you won&#39;t make that change. Join a gym in November. Don&#39;t live to excess in December. By the time January comes, it&#39;ll be easy to just carry on. And you will carry on.
I think Tess and Gwen should be forced to do a Supersize vs Super-skinny diet swap. Then at the end of the week, confront Tess and be like, &quot;But did you die???&quot; She&#39;ll probably be 40 lbs lighter too.
100% this was created by an American. Non-Americans would have made everyone fatter.
as the kids don&#39;t have an income of <br>their own....to buy this junk....<br>the FAULT lies with PARENTS or CARER....<br><br>....if the fat kid NEVER has any friends or girl/boyfriends - is made disabled or has limited fitness....is ISOLATED....etc<br>they become easier for these<br>WICKED parents to CONTROL....
The US of A is going rapidly into decline, and nowhere is this more obvious than in their so-called culture wars. Its citizens are encouraged to become unhealthily mega-fat through its addiction to mega-consumption, then the poor slobs are shamed for being unhealthily mega-fat, then the same slobs are told, no, it is beautiful to be unhealthily mega-fat... because the fashion labels say so and they want Walmart to share a bit of the XXL clothing market. Just keep those muffin and McFlurry supply lines going 🤣🤣
Although the percentage of obese people in the uk is almost as high as in the USA, as a European from another country, not UK, it seems that there are fewer super morbidly obese people in the uk.  I used to live in the uk and plenty of people are big, but there is lower cut off.  They have far fewer Slatons!  So it&#39;s not for the sake of shade!  In other ways perception of Americans from ny or california is very thin!
One of the most importan things I learned in History in H.S was what Party started the KKK. From that moment on, I swore I would <b>never</b> vote Democrat. It&#39;s my #1 icebreaker when someone says they vote Democrat. #2 is &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m so sorry&quot; and then pat them on the shoulder. I&#39;ve asked a few people if it was &quot;fatal&quot; too<br>Oh, and taking a Modern European History Class where half the class was the Rise and Fall of the Societ Union, and the other half was WW2, I will never support Communism. We read about some horrible things...and all these kids think &quot;their generation will &#39;fix&#39; Communism&quot;...if being obsessed with History makes you Republican, than being a Democrat really does make you ignorant of History
Sexy fat breast
People may be obese &amp; happy but I guarantee they’re not happy to be obese. Health is wealth.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=4m45s">4:45</a> in all fairness that statistic isn&#39;t really a comparison. one thing to credit the USA on there is the honesty of the statistic, when they say you&#39;re obese you are ACTUALLY obese. UK it not the same, most people branded &quot;Obese&quot; are above average weight at best. <br><br>I&#39;m a 5&#39;10, male - weighing at 15.4 stone(215.6 pounds?) and I&#39;m considered obese... When reality is im actually quite average in size. I fit most medium size clothing which at ideal weight(in with the UK claims is 12 stone- 168pound- at max) will still be my clothing fit.
wasn&#39;t there a video of a woman who danced inappropriately at her fathers funeral or something as well?
I remember almost going to fat camp but I kept on trying and I now have no chance of going there now
Some of these fat ladies have created a tribal identity around being fat.  They see getting skinny as a betrayal, an act of treason against the tribe.
Intentional Weight Loss Doesn&#39;t work? I&#39;m an even 6 in height. <br>At 18 I was a literal skeleton with skin and weighed 165lbs, at 30 I was 242lbs and quite fat. <br>Now at 32 I am 171lbs simply by cutting excess food and walking instead of taking the car or bus. <br>These people have no accountability and blame everything on society instead of introspecting.
Fat girls/boys can workout but if they eat more calories than they burn... they are consuming more energy than they burn. It is simple
Why does her family give her fatening food? I wouldn&#39;t
When I lost a lot of weight, some people in my family were a little worried I was going overboard. They never expressed worry about other people smaller than me. So I just think it&#39;s because they were used to something and seeing a dramatic change makes them aware of something going on. Maybe they were worried I would continue to loose a lot of weight even when I became thin/regular size. Especially since it happened quickly, it might have seemed like it was done in an unhealthy way and had become an obsession. Also, when a person looks a lot different from the last time you saw them, it&#39;s like meeting a new person, meaning they have &quot;killed a part of the person you knew and loved&quot;.<br><br>But then we also have fat people feeling betrayed as well, because they want others to have the same problem they have, that they can look up to, or point to whenever they want an excuse for how they live
I would read the comments on Supersize vs Superskinny episodes, and be very worried about the number of people in the comments saying &quot;Anyone with an ED here?&quot; &quot;This show makes me feel better about my ED!&quot; &quot;This triggers my ED but I can&#39;t stop watching!&quot;
Fat doc seems like she tried to lose weight thinking it only a matter of going to the gym and she didn&#39;t lose weight, got frustrated, and decided &quot;eh I don&#39;t have to lose weight&quot; 😂😂😂
Why are these fat people recording themselves eating and then uploading the video online. Isn&#39;t that just easy bait for trolls to say the harshest things they can think of?
They don&#39;t have to relinquish power. They have to be forced out. No one should be there for more than eight years and there should be no grandfathering. As for John Fetterman, he&#39;s just plain retarded
Fat shaming needs to make a strong comeback
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kKUTWZSg8&amp;t=4m20s">4:20</a> I agree with everything you say except for the &quot;personal choices&quot; rhetoric.  In an Ideal world yes our outcomes in life would be the complete result of our choices but in society as it is structured today (capitalism etc.) Most people are stuck within boundaries set by genetics and socioeconomic status hence the reason some of the poorest countries are the most obese. I 100% agree people should put all effort into self improvement but it is usually only the exceptional ones who will break free of their boundaries.  For the best results we need societal level changes.
I watched this when i was pretty into my anorexia and I remember the ways they tried to &#39;scare&#39; the skinny people were laughable.
Nah, im on skinny camps 😂
Marie needs some animal products… flesh and fat 😋
ik some1 who wet to a fat camp.... hes still afat lol
If you’re obese by choice, I shouldn’t have to pay for your healthcare.
Just wondering, where are any men in Taylah&#39;s life? She has children - where are the fathers? How are they pulling their weight?
So when Tammy dies, will the family be partially to blame because they enabled her food addiction? Everyone in that family is obese or morbidly obese. There is nothing &#39;cute&#39; about this show. TLC has turned into tabloid television. People love watching a train wreck.
I don&#39;t live in the UK anymore but we also have obese folks here now too. Growing up there was 1, yes ONE McDonald&#39;s restaurant in my town of fewer than 800 000 people. Now there are 10 McDonald&#39;s, 5 burger kings, 3 five guys, Edwards sandwich places, KFC Starbucks all over. What do most of these places have in common? Super size V super skinny was on when us style fast food was just starting to grow in the UK. They were not flexing they were trying to prevent the bad habits from forming. Warn people of the coming storm. Yes England invented capitalism but the us weaponised it. When you have socialised Medical care such as the NHS or SECU the govt uses media to cushion the blow of upcoming crisis. Because everything is free it puts more responsibility on the citizens to adjust their behaviour for the greater good. Super size as well as embarrassing bodies were part of an effort to make a generation who had never known rationing or war to be more conscious of the ways their behaviour affects other and the nation. Watching probably re-edited episodes years later without the long ass public service messages at the start and end is a very different experience. Not specifying these details as one complains about the finger pointing....come on...no no dear. This show exists in a social, economic and cultural context and you know it. I have my issues with Dr. discount Benedict Cumberbatch but he and those 2 other Dr ladies he worked with on ITV were trying to do good not only for the people but for the NHS in the sweet sweet summer pre Brexit days.
She&#39;s fattening up her kid so later on she can sell them to someone who is aroused by obesity either that or the mum is into fat people and she&#39;s going to date her son when he&#39;s older and fatter.
A lot of these fat acceptance people take half of a fact they kinda heard and run with it. Like being super lean 24/7 is unsustainable for most people because to do that you either have to be on tren or in a calorie deficit, both of which will cause health problems if continued for a long period of time. It is healthy to have some fat on you, however the healthy range is 18-30% depending on gender and genetics (some peoples bodies just work different. Though between 25 and 30% can still be healthy so long as ur eating healthy, drinking enough water and exercising enough. Clean bulks aren’t gonna cause any significant health problems). There is a point when it’s too much. Or how a lot of them say that 90% of the time dieting doesn’t work (I’ve heard eating healthy at all doesn’t work too, and that person is gonna die), which is true in reference to fad diets and changing your entire diet cold turkey. Making slow and gradual changes, finding healthy recipes you enjoy, not being super restrictive and meal prepping at least one meal every week is the key to long term success. The reason why fad diets don’t work is because the people who do them don’t understand nutrition and will just go back to eating how they used to after they’ve lost all the weight. The reason why cold turkey doesn’t work is because it leads to burnout. It’s the same reason being super restrictive doesn’t work, and on the people it does, it also borders on disordered eating and often there’s a correlation with an unhealthy relationship with food (Im not talking about athletes or something temporarily being super restrictive before like a weigh in or a show or something, Im talking about the instagram “nutritionists” who are like “you can’t eat bread, seed oil, meat, vegetables, water, milk ect.” They’re also the same ones who drink bleach because they believe it gives them health benefits. Basically the jilly juice mfs).
Steve was great! He was a former overweight person who understood what it wad like to be overweight. He wanted them to do well and knew that tiptoeing around things wasnt going to help. I loved this show beceuse it was about living healthier not getting skinny
Everyone here is a moron. Say it with me everybody, WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS WORKED. This fantasy of the husband being the provider and the woman being the pampered little stay at home mom has never been possible unless you were at the top of the food chain.<br>Both my grandmother&#39;s were traditional women. Guess what: they worked more than their brothers and fathers because not only were they expected to do all of the house work, they were also expected to so just as much manual labor as their brothers and fathers at their farm. And they also had no control over the money they made through that labor because they were women. Neither of them had education either, they both had to learn how to read by themselves and one of them who had to move to Australia had to learn to speak English. Stop selling your weird fetish life style as a feasable reality by using stupid women like that moron on the video that&#39;s crying over being a normal adult. I&#39;ve never acted that way because I remember the stories my grandmother&#39;s told me. All the suffering they went through just because they didn&#39;t have the right type of crotch.<br>And let&#39;s not fucking pretend that countries who still insist on living this way aren&#39;t the countries where people live in the most poverty. Also, I watched a documentary of young girls over there having to pretend to be boys because daddy dearest decided to abandon his wife and children because he couldn&#39;t father sons (the baby&#39;s sex is completely determined by the father&#39;s biology after all and that&#39;s a scientific fact) and the responsibility to take care of everyone fell on the shoulders of the daughter who is still young enough to pass as a boy.<br>Fuck. All. Of. You.<br>I&#39;ll have to slave my life away anyway, but at least now I can actually keep some of that money to myself and have some fucking independence.<br>If you wanna live this way, good for you, you do you, but get your hand away from my fucking rights.
Rice is a staple food for half the world&#39;s population, the other half that doesn&#39;t suffer from high rates of obesity. Just eat balanced meals. Problems arise when we eat too many calories and unbalanced meals. Protein and fats paired with starch and veggies will keep you healthy and satisfied.
This obese influencer is a grifter . She could easily lose weight if she lost her sense of taste.
The super big going on the super skinny diets… oh they’ll not last five minutes after the first meal
as a former fat person, it doesnt seem at all that you don&#39;t hate fat people. Fat people hate fat people and you just make them come out of their cognitive dissonance.
Jeffree Star aka Skinny Legend: &quot;I&#39;m a food/candy addict&quot;<br><br>Me: looks at gut, does inside
I am sure that the BP movement was more about disfigurement, differences and disabilities when it first came about. The obese co opted it and then complain and cut people out. Mental
As someone that used to be obese when I was younger, I feel the  &quot;junkfood&quot;  effect  just hearing the word TLC . And I could get &quot;psychological diabetes&quot; if I watch too much of it. So thank you for balancing it out with some healthy insight!
The story of this country is so incredibly sad….corporations did not pave paradise and put in a parking lot, they killed the land. BTW, the turkey tail is like what we call the “Pope’s nose” on a chicken. It is mostly fat but if roasted well, it is delicious.
&quot;about 25 pills a day&quot; I&#39;m on 3 meds + voluntary supplements and think that&#39;s a lot...but I&#39;m also 20 and a healthy weight. I do have a lot of issues with food, especially sugar addiction and binge eating, and if I hadn&#39;t lost about 60 lbs due to anorexia during the pandemic I&#39;d be obese rn. I&#39;m trying to improve, and I&#39;m making baby steps, but it&#39;s so hard... I never give up tho, that&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever done.<br>my pills are for my mental health (depression and adhd), so at least having to take them isn&#39;t a guilty thing, unlike food is for me 😅
They want equality to do this dumb shit and want to be respected.. hell no.. love woman but exactly a woman not a tramp hood rat hoe etc.. yah make money and act like yah owed something or yah gods plzz only one god father to Jesus who died for us.. 💯🇵🇷
Why is there so much obsession and discussion about fat people ?  <br><br>Why do others care so much about other people’s  weight ?  I seriously don’t get it .  <br><br>Can someone explain please .
Fat Camp is amazing
Jokes on all you guys and your jokes about how massive that I am, I am on the verge of compressing into a singularity, then you will be the fat one!
Mike Jeffries was ugly A/F yet he graded employees by their looks
Now people get shamed for being skinny.everyone is expected to look like a kardashian these days.
I am fat, I was even more fat, but I started eating a little less, and I lost weight.<br>Objectivly speaking, eat less, lose weight. If you have mental problems and dont fix that, you&#39;ll eat it right back, but eat less lose weight
Oh wow, I didn&#39;t know ppl so noisy about her weight back then. She&#39;s not even that fat, like, still in normal area? Fashion industry ppl are sick,.
This movie was a genuine insight and a beautiful portrayal of being addicted to food and hating yourself for it. Yes, the themes were kinda on the nose, but I didn&#39;t mind it. As someone who had weight issues and the wife of a formerly obese man, this was a very touching movie. I agree with most of your points, except for the ending. It did make me tear up, even though I saw it coming a mile away.
1 cookie will NEVER make anyone fat. A conveyor belt of anything will.
This movie: Portrays the struggles of an obese man in his every day life.<br>Fat positivity: <b>*in a whinny voice*</b> But why would you show it that way???? Waaaaahhhh!<br><br>Because is reality, you cry baby.
The ugly unknown lady who none has any clue about asks him for a drag look.<br><br>Jeffrey pops ONE single shadow on her (and brown) a tad of glitter and lashes. The end.<br><br>🤦🏻‍♀️<br><br>For real.<br><br>And the lady is annoying af! She cannot shut up!!!
Sooooo now all the muscular torsos moved to Instagram where they get massive following …. Glad k was never ugly and sanctimonious ….
a lot of the time the superskinny ones are just normal weight with a shit diet
I feel like men are not more oppressed than woman and im a man who does belive that life can be hard for men however woman are probably more oppressed not so much in ghis country (being the us) but in other countries more poor countries. In the us there were large problems with woman being oppressed and not having rights however I think that nodern day feminism in the us at least is pointless i dont think men have rights that women dont anymore which is correct. Life can be hard on men too however a man should provide for his family not rely on someone else to do it fathers shouldn&#39;t cry in front of they&#39;re children they shouldn&#39;t have to ask there children for help a father sgould be strong and leading <br>Do i belive that society made men be tough yes<br>Do i think that men should be storing and tough also yes. but to conclude i feel that woman in other countries are much more oppressed
Wonder what’s your opinion on sumo wrestlers?  Sumo wrestlers are fat
Am I getting this right? Is this a full series dedicated to an obese person? And it already has 3 seasons?
Saying that you used to be fat and acting like that&#39;s why you can&#39;t hate fat people is like saying you have a black friend after being called out for racism.<br><br>I don&#39;t know that you hate fat people, this is just a weird defense.
100% this was created by an American. Non-Americans would have made everyone fatter.
Wrong. Majority of the bros go to SEA because women in America/Europe are high standard in dating requirement like looks, height, balding, etc. They&#39;ve ran out of options there. So what they do now is to go to the other side of the world where basically every white men regardless whether you&#39;re ugly or not is considered a privilege. White men had a lot of options in SEA where basically women would fight for you just being white
According to me body positivity is not mocking someone for his/her looks- height, weight, hair etc. Every obese person knows that s/he is fat and need to weight loss. But for some people losing weight is tough maybe because of thyroid, pcod or other disease. We need to be supportive and empathetic to them. But some people misunderstand body positivity and thinks that being fat is fine. No it is not. Your body is temple and start worshipping it otherwise we cant adapt tha changing climate.
Why do they never make shows about enablers of 600lbs lives? You can&#39;t get up but you fat. Someone around you wants to kill you or has mental health issues themselves.

Omg yesss! I grew up thinking that the only way to be pretty was to be skinny, white, and have blonde straight hair. Even movies like the princess diaries (which is still one of my favorite movies) sent me on a rampage when I watched it about a year ago as an adult. The makeover scene basically tells young women that if you wear glasses and have curly hair then you&#39;re not considered to be &#39;attractive&#39; like damn no wonder I was so insecure about my appearance growing up.
I’m sorry I don’t feel sorry at all for people who are addicted to fast food. I just don’t. In the end it’s still choice. If a piece of food could make someone that ill like we see the lady in black practically vomit as if it’s a dead body, but she can handle fast food so easily, Fuck her. People act like they have no choice. They still have a choice. They can put something different into their damn mouth but they don’t want to because they want the pleasure of their fast food so let America die in its unhealthy decisions. I’m sick of people making excuses about why Americans are so fat and unhealthy. You’re adults not children. Put the damn shit that’s healthy in your mouth and swallow it. Unless you have issues that literally prevent you from eating, then you can do it. You just don’t want to.
You are not better than anyone, BUT , you are fatter than everyone...
Disney is not the same as the Disney I grew up with ,it&#39;s turned ugly😞
Island fat camp
If obesity was good, wild animals would be obese.<br>Have you ever seen a fat lion?
The second fast food kid is fat because both her parents are fat.
You should do a video on the British show fat families! It’s along the lines of secret eaters and supersize vs super skinny
I need an update on wether the son got his inheritance back, thats absolutly disgusting how the father stole from his own child like wtf is wrong with him and running his crummy buisness into the ground, hes a kevin
I was about to comment that I&#39;ve never felt insecure about my appearance, even though I&#39;m not exactly a D-cup model with long flowing hair xD But then I remembered the first time I went to Paris and how me and my sister felt like absolute trolls. Sure, we&#39;re skinny, but being Dutch, we felt so tall and unelegant compared to all the petite girls with thick, dark hair and mysterious dark eyes there. Somehow, everyone we saw in Paris who was our age, was ridiculously attractive looking. So yeah, I don&#39;t get insecure easily, but when surrounded by people who are all more elegant than I am... I totally get the feeling.
As someone that used to be obese when I was younger, I feel the  &quot;junkfood&quot;  effect  just hearing the word TLC . And I could get &quot;psychological diabetes&quot; if I watch too much of it. So thank you for balancing it out with some healthy insight!
Why make a video of this? <br>You get fat, that&#39;s all!
Maybe those 3 are providing an example of healthy masculinity the kid’s not getting from his father
I feel like it&#39;s hard to get nuance into a discussion about health 200 years after the fact. There&#39;s a difference between quantity and quality of life. And just because people were living to old age doesn&#39;t mean they were living to old age and being healthy elderly. I&#39;d be interested to see the rates of CVD and CVA in people who grew up in that golden period with so much consumption of saturated fat. Others have said in the comments section here the article doesn&#39;t discuss things like chronic disease- and they&#39;re right too. It&#39;s all good and well having a robust immune system that can fight off infection, but living under a cloud of smog and sweeping chimneys from the age of 5 is probably going to do a number on your lungs and will put you at risk of conditions like COPD and heart disease. I think another thing people often do gloss over is chronic disease is not a one-and-done- problems like COPD, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease etc can all be problems that take years to progress and manifest themselves as well. You would have to wait some time to see if someone&#39;s intersection of environment and genetics will cause them to to develop CVD, as an example
Fat people are funny 😅😂
Obese people generally live off the government they don&#39;t contribute to society it&#39;s a drain on social security
god, i used to be so miserable when i worked in hospitality. it was my WORST nightmare. i worked as a barista in a small family owned specialty coffee chain and they lived by &#39;the customer is always right&#39;. their big thing was to NEVER ask customers to leave, even after closing. in the summer, we had beautiful tables on a tall building&#39;s terrace overlooking the city and it was so nice at night. our business hours were 8AM-10PM but the strict company policy was to never ever kick guests out. they&#39;d let them sit outside until 11-12PM before very gently telling them we closed two hours ago, we would not get paid overtime, and on top of that, there was 30 more minutes of work to be done AFTER the last customers leave for closing. the place was located in an extremely boujee neighborhood and the people were very affluent and so incredibly entitled and abused the company policy to the fullest, only to leave a $1 tip for three people who stayed well into the night to accommodate them... it was the worst two years of my life working there. i was so unhappy. i hated our regulars from the bottom of my heart. DIRTY rich, zero manners, never tipped, talking about how they&#39;re cleaning their ex wives in divorces and sleeping with teenaged girls... there was one regular who had six sons by like 5 different wives, he would come in with them and his little ipad, order a single americano (no tip) and leave his six kids to terrorize the staff who had to keep them entertained (the youngest was maybe 18 months) and everyone had to suck it up because he was friends with the owners. when he was bored of his stupid offspring, he&#39;d bring them to us to babysit for free. never ordered a single drink/juice/food for the kids. i would literally walk up to a table without saying hello or smiling and just asking what can i get you. no hello, no goodbye, that job sucked the life out of me. i quit two years ago and i genuinely feel like i&#39;m still carrying that fatigue and stress in my bones.
So I was doing strength camps around that time. I weighed in just under 180lbs at 5&#39;11&quot;, had a 33&quot; waist, and A&amp;F clothes did not fit me right. My shoulders were too broad, and both my quads and calves were literally too big to get their pants on. It was absurd. Basically if you were a guy and were not legit skinny with muscles or just skinny, their clothes were not going to fit you. And by &quot;Skinny&quot; I don&#39;t mean 13%-15% BF, I mean sub 10% body fat if you had any type of athletic build. I&#39;d occasionally see regularly built guys with decent size muscles with button downs and T-shirts that were skin tight. I wondered why I never saw any of them with the shirts buttoned. When I tried some on I found out. It&#39;s because they could not button them.<br><br>As for the girls section, yeah, again, you needed to be crazy thin to fit into their clothes, and regular size hips on a size 5 was probably going to put you in a size 10 as the clothes ran so small across the board it was ludicrous. I liked the style of the clothes quite a bit, but the tailors who designed them definitely made their audience far smaller than it should have been. I mean c&#39;mon, I wore 32&quot; waist jeans/cargos in half of the brands I wore at the time, 33&quot; in the others, and I could not fit into their pants or shorts correctly? Stupid. Heh, I was a big <i>&quot;Dawson&#39;s Creek&quot;</i> fan though. That final episode. Oh those folks at the CW got me. Tearing up when I saw Jen talking to Grams, then the ending with Joey, Pacey and Dawson... <i>sniffle</i> Great, here I go again...
&quot;They would rather we remain addicted to medication our entire lives than be fat&quot; Why is this a binary choice you can not be fat and not be addicted to medication this is so disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. Its called poisoning the well and false equivalency. In fact everything she said there was the same all logical fallacies.
Ben, I understand that you’re upset about what happened to your homeland and rightfully so, but you’ve shown your true colors during these difficult times, and I gotta say that it’s truly ugly bro and I don’t support it and I’m done supporting a neocon war monger such as yourself.
The food industry has NOTHING to do with children being obese. Healthy food options are out there. Obese children are a direct result of lazy parents. Period.
I&#39;ve been watching this woman&#39;s videos and I do believe she&#39;s fat phobic. Being ex obese does not make you immune to be fat phobic. Indeed, some of the meanest, cruelest fat shaming people I&#39;ve known were once fat themselves.<br>I don&#39;t agree with people like Virgie Tovar either but I do not think we should shame or lecture fat people but we should only try to educate the best we can. There are many reasons why people are fat and it&#39;s not necessarily their fault. Obesity should be regarded as it is, a disease not a weakness nor people just being lazy.
People don&#39;t overeat because they don&#39;t know that overeating is bad. They overeat because they are addicted to the comfort of food. People become addicts because of trauma. They will never stop being fat until they learn a better way to deal with trauma.
Ive been sick since i was thin at age 16. Now im fat and sick. Drs just focus on the fat part. If i lose weight, my sickness will be taken seriously
Hey Kiana, I am extremely underweight. Fast metabolism. I can live a sedentary lifestyle and eat myself full of junk food day in day out, and I remain emaciated.<br>I&#39;ve tried to gain weight a lot to be healthier, but I just can&#39;t do it. So why would you assume every single obese person should be capable of losing a considerable amount of weight?<br>That makes no sense. If I can eat and live like a stereotypical obese person and stay thin, logically there should also be obese people who stay overweight even when cutting down on food intake and doing sports. Don&#39;t you understand that you were just lucky to be physically capable of getting out of it? It&#39;s nice that you want to help people be healthy, but please don&#39;t spread the lie that everyone is capable of doing what you have done.<br><br>Because this is the real reason people view your channel as promoting fatphobia. It has nothing to do with your own feelings on fat people. But the thing is ... where are all the channels with 100s of videos specifically about how underweight people like me are unhealthy and should gain weight? Why do I not constantly get told that I should make a change, even though I&#39;m clearly unhealthy? Why is that only done to fat people to such an unreasonable, concern-trolling extent?<br>No, I don&#39;t think you hate fat people, obviously. But you are indirectly helping cause harm to some fat people.
No James your not fugly
Many of the problems humans have are because society have developed faster than the human brain. The human brain looks for food. It used to be hard to get food.. therefore no overeating. Nowadays we have an abundance of food at our fingertips, all the time. So the human brain thinks &quot;must eat and store fat for the time there&#39;s a lack of food&quot;. Our brains haven&#39;t developed fast enough.
have you seen virgin mountain? it doesnt focus on the fat issue a lot but i really liked the movie
The parents of that 13 year old are infuriating, they&#39;re clearly causing the problem, they also fat as well, but they blame everything on the child.
the supersize complaining about the lack of food, acting hard done to taking nothing away from it -- Super skinny, feeling shame realising they dont really eat and all and understanding they actually have a problem and want to change.<br><br>It&#39;s an example of the selfishness and entitlement most overweight people have
Hahahaha imagine working at a company then they hide the snacks from you cause you don&#39;t have enough self control from getting too fat..
To me anything meat is unhealthy, i dont get where people got the idea that meat is healthy. The dumbest is when they say animal fats (saturated and trans fats) are &quot;healthy fats&quot;.<br>Plant based diets are all full of nutrients and fiber that most people are missing and they produce the most longevity in humans. Carnivore dieters always have high cholesterol and blood pressure from eating so much dietary cholesterol and salt.
I am filipina that live in pacific island. (new zealand) i agree most people here are obese, since their diet and culture are different from other.
I truly do not like to see fat stomachs out in crop tops. Like...it doesn&#39;t fit! Just pick a different shirt
Imagine being so fat your body has to store it in your forehead...
It’s just crazy that  it took a fat comment for people to be outraged at the brand. Not the creepy behaviour, not the racism or the way they were targeted teens. Or how they treated the workers
Dr. Rob Cywes talks a lot about carb-addiction and stress-management. <br>And he never blames fat people, he meats them where they are. <br>He makes them eat KETO or CARNIVORE while trains them to part with their &quot;best friend&quot; - carbohydrate that comes in all shapes, forms and tastes.<br>Never good to blame the victims.
The only tattoo I&#39;ll ever get is the tattoo my father got of a traditional Lithuanian crusader to represent our Lithuanian heritage

You&#39;re so skinny.
It used to get me so angry when I&#39;d see  anyone stay with a toxic family member.  Then I remember the under meltdown my siblings had when I cut off my abusive addict father and my mother, who defended him. I mean, I still cut them off despite my siblings&#39; protests.  But I can see why it&#39;s hard for others.
Thank you for this misinformations videos. Meat is probably what keeps them alive despite not being the best available. Fruits are full of fructose which contribute to fatty liver, they are as healthy as candy. But hey, don&#39;t let science in the way of your misinformations.
I always love your videos! L’Oreal also has some new skinny bullet lipsticks. I haven’t tried them yet but I’m so curious about how they perform.

You know what that first woman needs before dying horribly in her own blubber and widening sores? Fat acceptance, even liberation. That&#39;s it. Kumbaya.
Say there is superskinny, skinny, normal, chubby, big.<br>Amy is normal-chubby. In the real world not every girl is deadly skinny. Plus, if your height is 180cm you cannot fucking wear a size 2 and look alive.
the only problem with your stupid bs argument Ben is that your basis for it is based in some made up bullshit about a floaty dude in the sky that lives in a castle of gold and if you worship him enough you will go there when you die. You supporting the ABOLISHMENT of ALL FORMS OF ABORTION means that women who are going to have a fatal delivery, or a child that will be born into pain and disability and never have a life worth living, all those options to abort DANGEROUS pregnancies will go with it. you are a fkn idiot to say that there is no legitimacy in ANY abortion.
The ugly unknown lady who none has any clue about asks him for a drag look.<br><br>Jeffrey pops ONE single shadow on her (and brown) a tad of glitter and lashes. The end.<br><br>🤦🏻‍♀️<br><br>For real.<br><br>And the lady is annoying af! She cannot shut up!!!
So when Tammy dies, will the family be partially to blame because they enabled her food addiction? Everyone in that family is obese or morbidly obese. There is nothing &#39;cute&#39; about this show. TLC has turned into tabloid television. People love watching a train wreck.
They seem quite miserable for a &quot;fat and happy&quot; person. I think that it&#39;s just as much about how they feel about living in their own body as it is about societal influence. Carrying around a large amount of excessive weight has a lot of physical consequences that make life harder. I&#39;d be miserable too. It&#39;s sad to see that this person was aware of the truth and saw they needed to make some changes...but then the FA crowd convinced them that helping yourself is &quot;oppressive&quot;. <br><br>And claims that the world would rather fat people &quot;die&quot; than remain fat makes no sense...if that were generally true, everyone would be greatly discouraging them from losing weight and bettering their health. That&#39;s something I only see within the FA crowd, itself.
my father is old doe
What does idiot and know that God is often referred to as father.  My father, who’s thout in heaven.<br>I am a father and the last time I checked I do have a penis. Therefore God has a penis.
People may be obese &amp; happy but I guarantee they’re not happy to be obese. Health is wealth.
Fats can be trans too?
The parents. They buy the junk their kids eat.<br>Its not &quot;fat shaming&quot;, its the truth.<br>Also, who runs that house. Brushing your teeth is a no brainer.<br>Stop buying junk and buy fruit and veggies.<br>That female is not a parent. She just popped out babies. 😢
I&#39;ve never been able to work out if Jesse is genuine crazy or if he&#39;s just playing to be funny. He got brought on uk tv once , ITV GMB, biggest daily news show, not long after George Floyd died and he was cut off after about 10 seconds because all he said was .....<br>&quot; Black lives matter was founded by fat, black lesbiens!&quot; <br>Cut. 😂😂😂😂
Adele was pretty before, in my opinion. But seeing her after her weight loss being more confident in herself makes her even more attractive. as a fat person myself i think anyone whos mad at her is truly just jealous of her
Black, brown, white, fat, skinny, tall, short, rich, poor, male, female!! We are all the same underneath, we all feel shame, which is beyond ridiculous. But thank god for some of the stronger beautiful successful people who have put themselves out into the light and helped us feel that maybe, just maybe, someone will believe that is was not our fault. Tears fall as I write this and I feel so much respect and love for you beautiful woman. Thank you thank you, let us all remember our humanity. Hold on to your kind hearts ♥️
I have a super slow and sluggish metabolism due to having an Atomic cocktail  (Radioactive Iodine) when I was 24 and being on Thyroxine for so many years, I&#39;m now 68 and gain weight incredibly quickly, I&#39;ve learned to have a three-day fast, drinking water only, about 3 times a month, most often I eat one to two high protein meal a day, no carbs, and once a week I have a high good fat extra large salad, with either olive oil, avocado oil, and sheep&#39;s milk cheese with braggs vinegar, that is my only raw veggies for the week, and I may have cooked non starchy vegetables once a week as well, other than that I only eat beef,  un - farmed salmon steaks, and pasture raised eggs, decaf coffee with  heavy cream and sweetened with burch xylitol, also some frozen wild blueberries a couple times a week... This has been a very effective approach for a steady and slow weight loss for me, I also love mall walking and climbing up very high hills  4 times a week, I&#39;ve learned as well that at my age a one to two hour nap especially after being active is necessary daily...It&#39;s been such a startling realization to me to learn how truly little food I need to  thrive in life.
If people are so emotional over her losing weight, it should really speak to the systemic problem of representation in the media. So many people mad they don’t have someone to look up to who doesn’t fit a mold. It’s not Adele’s fault and she shouldn’t have to suffer from the lack of fat representation.
The things i have heard from pediatricians, would make you cry. Parents never once giving their child water or juice to drink. Instead it is Soda, chocolate milk, sweet tea, coffee etc. &quot;He just loves mcdonalds nuggets&quot; &quot;He is so big and strong for his age&quot;...No lady he is fat, cause you are feeding him garbage.
OMG yes it was totally my dream to go to fat camp as a child as well! I wasn&#39;t even particularly fat, just demonstrably not the skinny child my parents wanted me to be.
I have found the closer with my mom I get, the more reckless and impulsive I get. The closer with my dad I get, I’m reminded to be thankful and have manners and try and be nice and patient. My dads always hugged me and loved me in public and he’s pushed me to make friends and work and do good at school. He listens to my choir music and asks about my day every day and I’m sure that really started to pay off when I started to ask him about his too. I’d come down to his home office sometimes and ask if I could help him with work haha. Good fathers are sooo needed. I’d lose my head if I only had my mom. I’d be a terrible human tbh
According to me body positivity is not mocking someone for his/her looks- height, weight, hair etc. Every obese person knows that s/he is fat and need to weight loss. But for some people losing weight is tough maybe because of thyroid, pcod or other disease. We need to be supportive and empathetic to them. But some people misunderstand body positivity and thinks that being fat is fine. No it is not. Your body is temple and start worshipping it otherwise we cant adapt tha changing climate.
Easy tip for weight loss.<br>Become fat adapted and learn about fat fasting.<br>Fat reduces hunger and cravings meanwhile sweets and carbs increase hunger and cravings. <br><br>You&#39;re all welcome
You wanna talk about chair issues, try being left handed and sitting in those school chair-desk combos made for right handed people. The amount of times I tried to stand up by getting out on the left side, and then biffing it in front of the class 😂 I&#39;m overweight, mainly due to my own admitted laziness, and I don&#39;t fit into the chairs at my dentist. I just laugh and say my fat ass doesn&#39;t fit in their chair, so give me a moment while I try think skinny lol It&#39;s gonna be ok. I&#39;m gonna be ok if I don&#39;t fit in the chair or if a desk is the wrong way for me. There are bigger problems to worry about in life that need legitimate attention. 🤦‍♀️
Why make a video of this? <br>You get fat, that&#39;s all!
I&#39;m actually really happy I found you, after my grandfathers passing my father hasn&#39;t been the same. My dad constantly eats chips, McDonalds, basically whatever food he can get his hands on he&#39;ll eat. We used to order a lot from UberEATS but quit because we couldn&#39;t afford it. My family learned my father had applied and received a credit card and maxed it out within the month, every day my dad would order over $200 of food, eat it in secret and throw away the trash in a neighbors garbage. We caught him when the letter in the mail for his credit card came and since my mother does all the billing she was shocked. He broke down emotionally, threatened to take my life because I wouldn&#39;t share my food, and has broken down and cried multiple times.<br><br>I started watching your videos on our TV and it finally got my father interested in watching. No progress has been made YET! I&#39;m hopeful my dad will watch and will get help. From time to time I hear your videos play on our TV. It breaks my heart to see my dad this way and I hope he gets better.<br><br>Dad if your reading this I love you, I miss him too.
&quot;Fat cells are the bodies trash can&quot; - Dr Roni
I felt bad for Daniel for a long time because his father stole his inheritance money, until I researched more about his grandfather. Allen’s father was actually the biggest gangster in Australia for decades, so that inheritance was obviously blood money.
As a Dominican my family is skinny and fit we got to a gym for all ages and eat right but idk if that has nothing to do with my race because I&#39;m also Arabic and Black
Nothing great about a fat body!! Its a pain in the ass! I hate it. Exercise ain&#39;t going to do it!
It’s not just choices. When nutritious food is way more expensive than cheap junk food, then something is wrong. Those who don’t have the income end up fatter and malnourished.
I remember almost going to fat camp but I kept on trying and I now have no chance of going there now
Same. I was 260 at my heaviest. I will never be the skinny kid in my heart. Some of my<br>Coworkers think of me as the “skinny guy” despite the fact that I don’t have any veins, my waist is 31”, I have bad cardio, etc.<br>Hearing that they think I’m skinny doesn’t really help. In the moment it might make me feel better about myself, but in the long term it makes me only feel like a fraud… I don’t really handle compliments well because of the time that I was fat and all the fake compliments I got trying to get a rise out of me, no real affection for my entire teenage years through to adulthood.<br>Since losing the weight my confidence has gone up but not to a level where I feel confident. I just feel like I’m constantly on the verge of tears because I have no self-image anymore and I have no idea who to trust.
I think this is why my sister is a sort out individual because my fater never stopped hugging his little girl. I am her big brother cant be more proud of that girl, she is the smartest girl i met. She studies a lot and mind her own business.
I&#39;m glad I watched this video, as someone who&#39;s struggled with being the chubby kid all my life, when i looked through your channel I got extremely bad vibes. Because I am someone activeley working on myself. Eating better, exercising, everything. But when I saw your videos all I saw were clickbait titles and I got very uncomfortable. I wasn&#39;t even aware of this fat positive movement, I was only ever aware of the bigger body positive movement. Which I am very much in support of. And I&#39;m glad you clarified obese because a lot of people think overweight and obese are the same thing and they very much aren&#39;t.
Serena is a big ugly bitch and shes also very annoying and rude idgaf if she is good at throwing balls. Ashley is a fatass who has no talent at all. can a fat man become famous/rich by pretending to be a model? Hell naw
Ashley’s laugh reminds me of my grandfather 👴 😂
<b>gasp</b> &quot;so you think I&#39;m skinnYYYYYYYYYY&quot; got me dieing 💀
I just think she look prettier fat. There&#39;s some people that honestly look better when they are bigger. Like Jonah Hill, he looked better when he was fat. He looks creepy thin. Not saying she doesn&#39;t look pretty now, she does. She just looks different. I guess I just need some taking used to. But props to her. If she feels like that&#39;s what she needed to do to evolve in life, then so be it.
I remember this episode, especially once that father guy said he&#39;s from Poland therefore he knows all about the mushrooms. Now I see his wife shares that belief.<br>As a Polish person I swear I don&#39;t have a clue what they mean. Of course we have mushrooms in Poland but they are not especially important to most traditional (or &quot;traditional passing&quot;) recipes. I&#39;m also surprised by the lack of Polish accent?
It’s such a weird thing to put that on a singer. Or anyone. She’s not your therapist. She writes and sings/performs songs.<br><br>Also, given that most adults ARE obese now, she USED to look like everyone else and NOW she doesn’t.
I&#39;m pretty sure in one of the earlier seasons the &quot;superskinny&quot; was a woman who had suffered from ED in her past.
no ones tricking me into eating healthy, if i worked at google id be one fat fuck
I know three people who need to go to fat camp and two of them are my best friend 🗿
As a fat person in the process of creating a better lifestyle, thank you for saying that “fat people don’t like being fat.” Because that is so true. I use to feel bad for saying that because I didn’t wanna seem like I didn’t love myself. But when you think about it it’s like, “well you don’t. Cause you’re not working on being healthier. You’re just gaining more weight.” I’ve always felt that way of not liking being fat. &amp; I’ve never heard other people say that.
Kim kardashian is truly a scary individual. She’s blinded so many people and yet everything she does gets overlooked. <br>It’s actually terrifying how she has the ability to cry on demand and control the narrative as she mentioned in the text messages with rayj. Tbh I&#39;m not a Ray j fan at all. Neither Kim. BUUUTT, the way Kim portrayed Ray J that he was the master behind the whole sex tape scandle. And the fact Kim kept crying and making it seem like she was the victim has me shook. And the fact that her mom watched the sex tapes! It&#39;s crazy. I&#39;m just glad Ray j is speaking up cause its different now that he has a family and they keep throwing him under the bus<br>She’s able to tell women to get off their asses and work and yet she owns 35% of skims..Emma grede a black woman owns majority of her company is is the brains behind skims. But Kim gets all the credit. She’s able to offend people as a pr stunt and they somehow forget because she posts her ass in a jock strap. She once said in her show that her late father called her “vain” and this is the woman who stated she would eat shot if it meant that she stayed looking young. Shes conceited and thinks she has power. She literally tried to cash the queen jubilee and was reminded of how the world perceives her. She’s brainwashed a lot of black peoples. She can say something offensive but that’s okay as long as she gets a few black people out of jail. Kanye changed that entire family. He designed the logo for skims and Kim just sits back and collects the money. SHE IS NOT A BILLIONAIRE..it’s all hype just like how she buys her Instagram followers. If her mother takes 10% off each daughter than with her having two “billionaire” daughters.. she just is she worth $150 mill..why is Emma grede the woman behind skims,good American and safely cleaning products worth $350 mill ? <br>It’s all a facade. Her mother sold her for fame..which is why kanye will do anything to prevent her from doing the same things with his kids. I noticed that Kim refers to chicago as her “mini me” she’s a pretty little girl and I hope her mother doesn’t do the same thing her grandmother did with her. <br>Kim is trying to get into politics and I seriously hope people don’t allow her to get into politics. America will be seen as a even more of a joke. I don’t hate the Kardashian’s but I don’t like the lies and the way they lie about the obvious surgeries. Young teens and adults should not watch the Kardashian’s. They should not be influenced by those people
Oh god i cant stand this man&#39;s ugly face...disgusting!!
&quot;They would rather we remain addicted to medication our entire lives than be fat&quot; Why is this a binary choice you can not be fat and not be addicted to medication this is so disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. Its called poisoning the well and false equivalency. In fact everything she said there was the same all logical fallacies.
Jamie if you are reading this, we demand an apology for you skinny shaming that 16 year old girl, blaming your older sister for being fat and  comparing your self to her and other things, which you know what they are, Repost this on Jamie&#39;s video to get the message out!!
Thanks to my father, who bought home fresh and healthy food, taught us to cook it and eat it in moderation.  And thanks to my mother, who also cooked for us and allowed us McDonald&#39;s no ofen than once every two-three months. <br>I grew up healthy and have a good relationship with food.
More like fat check
Dont worry jaimie, your not fat.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>your bigger than that. 🥰
Well there are 3500 cals in a pound so it&#39;s not physically possible to lose a pound of fat in a day.  Not unless you eat literally nothing and are a bodybuilder or about 600lbs. Most of the weight loss is water/lean tissue. Scamming dieters is one thing but selling snake oil to the terminally ill is on a whole other level of evil.
For me the eyeopening moment that made me realize I needed to eat healthier and loose weight was in 2020 after a 6month furlough due to pandemic. <br><br>I have always been lucky that I was a skinny teen despite eating whatever I wanted. People thought I was undereating until they actually saw me eat 😅 So between 16 and 25 I ate whatever I wanted without gaining an ounce, I stayed the same weight throughout give or take 1kg. And not really developing healthy eating habits 😅<br><br>When I came back to work from my furlough last year, my work uniform was too small and I had to ask my boss for a bigger size (embarassing). This prompted me to ask myself «did I really gain so much weight lately?» 🤔 And for the first time in 10 years, I stepped on the scale. Bit of a shock to see I had actually gained over 20kg in the last 10 years. I suddenly very clearly saw myself turning into my mom. <br><br>My mom is the most wonderful kind and generous person in the world and I love her so much, but she is quite overweight. I see her struggle, now in her 60’s, when we go shopping. She needs breather breaks and small distances for her seem many miles, painful on her joints and too exhausting. I can see the health problems her weight is causing and I realized I do not want to turn into my mom. I want to be able to walk without pain or exhaustion when I am in my 60’s. I want to travel without fitting too tight in seats on transportation. I want to be more fit and healthy than my mom is now when I reach that age. <br><br>I realized my streak of eating whatever I wanted was over and that I needed to eat less, more healthy and start exercising. If I didn’t, I would just gain another 20kg the next 10 years and then I would really notice health problems. <br><br>So for me, loosing weight now means staying fit and active and capable of doing whatever I want in the future and in my old age. I want to be an active world travelling granny! ☺️ Not sure if that vision is clear enough but for me, not becoming my mom, is a great motivator 🤷‍♀️ I lost 5kg in the past 6months so I am taking it slow and steady so I can keep this new healthier eating patern for many years to come.
Americans are not Fat, they are just jealus.<br><br><br><br>Go ahead And roast me, i dont Care.
If anyone wants proof of what jamie did look up &quot;jamieskinnyshamingvids&quot;<br>They have some of the videos including the sister with cancer one. It&#39;s very informative even though I already know about them.
Maybe it&#39;s because William is already seen as a direct successor to the throne. His father is pretty old he may abdicate, and Elizabeth was very young when she became queen.
People saying she was an example that you can be fat and successful still applies. Her weight loss now doesn’t negate her story of success.
List of that stuff she has done<br>Skinny shamed <br>Made a video  with her sister that has cancer with the caption “ who’s healthier now?”<br>Literally lied by saying body positive and that we are besties <br><br>Also, something to say  THERE IS MORE
You be you and your not fat your just beautiful inside and out ❤️❤️❤️
This is why you’re fat you don’t work out and you complain literally
There may be as many &quot;obese&quot; people in the UK as the US - but obese starts at 90kg (about 200LBS) for a 5&#39;9&quot; man, barely even noticeable, and there&#39;s no upper limit.. there aren&#39;t many people in mobility scooters or needing cranes to be lifted out of bed.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s shocking for British people.
Gurl u ain&#39;t nobody&#39;s &quot; fav body pos bestie &quot; ur littealy body shaming skinny and ACTUALLY healthy ppl...
Just remember every time you see a health at every size or fat acceptance video this is the choice they have made and the chemicals that has driven that decision they are addicts wanting acceptance for their addiction
STOP SCROLLING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE A At this point, we all know that Jamie reads the comments because these videos CANT be serious. So, instead of fat jokes, let&#39;s fill the comments with this message so that she knows we know she&#39;s trolling us. If you are Jamie reading this, we DEMAND an apology for skinny shaming that 16 year old girl, blaming your older sister for you being fat and other things. Repost this on all of Jamie&#39;s videos to get the message out!
There is a similar docu/reality series as 600 lb life of british origin called Fat doctor.Some episodes of it is on You Tube. That series not as intrusive to the people recieving the surgery but they are interviewed in depth and one can notice they have already done some amount of mental and intellectual scrutinizing about their weight as to the when, why and whats around their weight. And they also interview the doctors more and also show more of the medical procedure as such, which some perhaps may find &quot;gory&quot; in some of the episodes where it&#39;s not blurred out but to some it might be worth to see the fat aprons they need to get by to get to the stomach pouch covering but put burden on the organs. This especially since some Fat Tokers try to argue that visceral doesn&#39;t exist (but even skinny people can have it).
OK GUYS! She skinny shamed! It’s bad I know. But you should realize that fat shaming her doesn’t make you any different from her, right?
Why are people feeling bad for her? She sat next to her little sister who had cancer and said look whos healthy now? She skinny shamed a lot of other people, and has done some really sh1tty things in the past.
Where is ur teeth and also don&#39;t listen to people who call you fat ur bigger than thatXX
Babe we’re not your besties <br><br><br>Besties do not skinny shame people<br><br><br><br>           APOLOGIZE!!!!!!
Dude I can’t stand when morbidly obese people use the tag “plus-size”. Like just stop living in denial already.
A IMPORTANT MESSAGE A Jamie has skinny shamed so may people in one of her deleted videos she was next to her EIGHT YEAR OLD sister who had CANCER and captioned it &quot;Who&#39;s healthier now?&quot; She&#39;s an awful person. Don&#39;t try to defend her. She doesn&#39;t deserve it.<br>She has said so many awful things and acts like an angel. Why would you say &quot;aww slayy so beautiful.&quot; Or<br>&quot;your so pretty never let anybody bring you down!&quot;<br>When she honestly doesn&#39;t deserve it. If she acted differently and was a good person then sure, support her but she isn&#39;t she&#39;s a awful human. (Not my comment but we should keep forwarding this to any vid from her channel to show her true colours.) original from jamie shoulddoamukbang
&quot;EEEEEEEUUHHH SO YOU THINK IM SKINNYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot;<br><br>Boiii what😭😭😭
I am totally with you on this!  Do not eat the Pizza and I do not!  Now I do not but earlier in my life i did!  I am 59 years old now and I am now weigh 159.  When I was in my twenties, I used to weigh about 230.  I have been in the proper BMI for my last 20 years.  I feel just like you do!  I feel even now that I am a fat person or at least I have it in me to be a fat person and I have to constantly be vigilant to watch what I eat.  I have learned to watch my caloric intake verses my steps daily and it seems to work for me......Just wished I could quick smoking!  LOL....We all have our vices!
Ok so i a big movie junkie and i want to take a wild guess here and say before i see it in an episode. That guy who works for those people who tried to kidnapped the guy and his son. He is Henry father lmao. I think thats will happen by the last episode.<br>Lol i was wrong... well at least it didnt take to long.
MD / psychiatrist / psychoanalyst here. Agree with what I see as a first pass analysis of the problem here. Then there are the feeders: There s a syndrome in the spouses of disabled-obese women: we call them feeders. Its a kind of toxic control / codependence / hostility / misogyny - who else is getting this woman&#39;s obscene amount of food? Self sabotage in this case is a kind of &quot;para-suicide&quot; my guess is her developmental history is horrific. Over simplification will not help....no excuse for eating as much as you do - this is BS - eating too much is a way of destroying the self....I am not going into the identification with the aggressor / victim themes....Was surprised at how much weight she lost once she ended the relationship with her feeder..G
Y&#39;all be rude to her she just felt like doin a short y&#39;all are saying it makes sense fat shaming is a shitty move y&#39;all probably ugly as shit
Fat is not a personality trait. 🙃
I actually prefer the realness of this show, who actually would want the fake smiles and all this said behind your fatty back then in your face?
as the kids don&#39;t have an income of <br>their own....to buy this junk....<br>the FAULT lies with PARENTS or CARER....<br><br>....if the fat kid NEVER has any friends or girl/boyfriends - is made disabled or has limited fitness....is ISOLATED....etc<br>they become easier for these<br>WICKED parents to CONTROL....
love these two women but they dont really have the average life.. missing a childs steps, well that is part of your chosen path..at home mums see that but we gave up our career to be there at all times. Traveling with children, take toys and games that engage them and be prepared to be engaged with them at all times of the journey (did this for years with my 3 traveling solo with them back and forth across the pond)..and yes breast feeding you keep some fat to produce milk.
I think most probably the majority of the common citizens never thought about Adele’s weight. It is the fatphobic agenda of the mass media. Such hypocrits
She skinny shames and then wants to talk abt body shaming like smtn ain’t adding up 😂
I find it horribly insulting for her to compare obesity to being black. Race isn&#39;t a social construct, one is born as such. People arent generally born obese. What a pile of horse 💩. She is crazy. And furthermore, one person is a he, she, or it, not a they.
We <b>DEMAND</b> an apology(with tears) Skinny shaming a 16 year old is <b>NOT RIGHT</b> and saying &quot;Who&#39;s healthier now?&quot; To your sister with cancer is <b>COMPLETELY</b> <b>UNACCEPTABLE</b>
Never be a stay at home father for a CEO mother!  90% divorces are instigated by &quot;educated&quot; women. You end up at 50 with no career and no access to your own children. Father CEOs make money for a family. Mother CEOs make money for her &amp; the kids. There are few exceptions
Ok Ashley and Amy, don&#39;t you think that thin people have feelings too??????  It&#39;s as if you are on a bandwagon downing thin folks &quot;WHY&quot;.  I have never starved myself, and I surely never WHINE about what others are or are not eating.  Why would I care? I myself practice a Keto and Bullet Proof meal plan (not diet) 90% of the time maybe more - only because I feel amazing when I don&#39;t have all the sugar in my body.  I have never in my life counted calories.  If size doesn&#39;t matter then why the heck are you dwelling on it non-stop the entire interview - its as if it&#39;s your HOOK and Mission to continue downing anyone that is not your large... and it&#39;s old news.  When we stop bringing all the attention to this expired message - no one will give a F.... Seriously.  It&#39;s as if you are promoting Fat and Big Girls - A Big Women and Men Unite Message (It&#39;s Us against the THIN People - how immature that is - when you think about it.  I love when talk shows give rewards for people who&#39;s lost 100 pounds - I&#39;m kidding... I&#39;m not a fan - what about the people who never gained 100 pounds in the first place and loved their bodies enough to eat for nourishment and other healthy reasons.  Where&#39;s their reward?  Don&#39;t want one - just enjoy feeling good - because feeling good is the reward.  The point is - get over the weight and size issues and complaining.  And....you have to ask Amy what size she is - that alone is irrelivant ... why don&#39;t we move-on to a productive conversation, that&#39;s much more exciting and INTERESTING.  Many of us don&#39;t care how big or small you are and if we do - then we are the one with the problem.  Silence is the most powerful message and when you don&#39;t give it worth or value - it fades fast.  When we stop caring about what others think of us - then and only then, we&#39;ve really grown as whole.  I&#39;m just so tired of the We are Large/Big/Fat and we love it message.  If a think person were to say I love being thin/pretty/sexy then we are the bad guy and shame on us....Just giving an example here.  Great &quot;you&#39;re big and love the way it feels on &quot;you&quot; but let us move on.  And one last thing.  The whole REVERSE CASTING IN THE MEDIA etc. - now says..... if you are thin and pretty, you are not &quot;real&quot; In casting many say - We want &quot;Real People&quot; wow that is sad that we&#39;ve come to that - another form of discrimination in REVERSE.   It&#39;s the other side of Discrimination and many won&#39;t recognize that because they are angry/mad/bitter and the list goes on....  I&#39;ve never hated on anyone because of the way they looked or their size.  And yet, this is where we are - comparing everyone.  It&#39;s all backwards thinking and non-productive.  And now..... if you say anything... share how you FEEL.... it&#39;s considered political incorrect.  It&#39;s just wrong in way you dice it up.  you can&#39;t breath in the wrong direction anymore. Yes, there are bullies and mean insensitive people on the planet - but the only way we get past it is to start focusing on the opposite and the positives and how can we be the best version of ourselves.  How can we give back, what can we go better.  Where&#39;s that convo?  This conversation is so stale and self-involved and mentions nothing about &quot;giving, sharing, loving etc.  All you 2 discuss is your size and all the issues that go along with it.  It&#39;s just not interesting and who is it helping by ranting and dwelling on the obvious?  I like you both a lot --and I was hoping for an exiting and interesting interview, but you lost my attention fast and this are just parting words I felt I could share - since there is a comments section:)
I always love your videos! L’Oreal also has some new skinny bullet lipsticks. I haven’t tried them yet but I’m so curious about how they perform.
This is the type of content we want. Not the narcissistic skinny shamer jaimie
We deserve and apologize you were skinny shaming a 16 yr old!!! Like if you agree!!<br>👇🏽
Former binge eater myself, I beat this disease almost a decade ago and became a competitive cyclist. I came across your channel by accident a few days ago, and, Kiana, I can’t stop watching! Holy shit I had no idea I needed this type of content! I had no clue mukbang or fat activism even existed to this extent. I’m well aware of all the science you’re highlighting throughout your videos, but the delivery is so entertaining, I watched almost every video. Keep it up 👏
&#39;Releasing fat!&quot; 🤣BTW isn&#39;t eating less than 300 Calories &#39;deadly&#39;? Please do not go for these bizarre diets guys, exercising/walking/swimming are the best ways to reduce weight along with a &#39;Normal&#39; junk-free diets.
You know what jaimie.Shamming a 6 yo fir being skinny .comparing your self to your OWN sister with cancer. Is is to far.u really need to Apologize to us and them.
Yall see that bag shes holding right?<br><br><br>Well I bought the same bag and it was extremely big I was the size of a whole planet!
Jeffree: “And no I don’t mean your father”<br><br>My Friend: “HE FOUND HIM?! He left me years ago!”<br><br>Im deceased 🤣
Stop complaining ! It’s like jail and expensive ? Good let that be a lesson to them and especially they’re parents to maybe look at the food they are eating . It’s not like they were forced to get obese .
skinny shaming a 16 year old is rude and not ok
Yes. If a cause is not enough to justify wives and mothers fighting and dying, why is it enough to justify sending husbands and fathers.
bro really the fat queen CONSORT of being fat. Camilla is has been old her whole life… Jain je has been fat.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>OHHH THE…..<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>AMUSEMENT
Kalorie Gross and Ashley Kilograham. Queen&#39;s Shit😘💩
Thank you for raising awareness about obesity.<br>My wake up call was my diagnosis with sleep apnea. I started losing weight and never looking back.
Fat jokes NEVER go too far. The feeling of &quot;shame&quot; exists for a reason. You feel that because you know you&#39;re not supposed to be that gross. Go to the gym .
Just saw the documentary. It was fascinating to see a part of my childhood deconstructed like that. Still, I&#39;m not sure I agree with the general idea that the backlash against the brand and the effects are &quot;good&quot;. <br>First of all, there wasn&#39;t really any karmic punishment here. There was no comeuppance. The man was making 40 million a year for a while and then quit working with a 27 million dollar retirement payout. He won. He&#39;s a winner. Second, while I definitely agree that certain aspects of the company needed to come under scrutiny and needed to be eliminated (the treatment of the models or the sexualization of teenagers, for instance), I don&#39;t think trying to force the brand to cater to everyone at the risk of being destroyed by public outcry was a good strategy. <br>Abercrombie was built on one idea of what the ideal All-American look/lifestyle is. People who disagreed with that idea, who found themselves excluded from it for their skin color, religion, or body shape could have come together to build a new brand that took the same idea and expressed it in a way that was inclusive, without trying to force the notion that the traditional, very conservative, very preppy, very white idea of Americana needs to die. Why? Why can&#39;t the people who still feel that way have businesses that cater to them? Why isn&#39;t there room for more than one idea of American identity? <br>If you don&#39;t feel like a business fits you, take your money elsewhere. Why do you have to actively try to destroy it so you can feel validated at all times in all places by all people? Like, I know Chick-fil-A doesn&#39;t like me. I know it doesn&#39;t want my business. I&#39;m not going to picket to try to force them to do it, I&#39;m just going to buy my chicken elsewhere. Will I let other people know about the things I disagree with about Chick-fil-A? Sure. But if they choose to still go there, I&#39;m not going to cry about it and start a protest.
I would like to see a psychological study of why people decide to create the ugliest persona possible. It started in the sixties as an opposition to societal norms but has continued to the present with people becoming more and more ugly and deranged. Why?
&quot;things she did when SHE was fat&quot;<br>Skinny shame a girl with cancer
All this one size fits all is complete bull shit
What I hate about kids&#39; makeup is that they think they should and can get away with making it cheap and gross. It&#39;s one thing if you want to think for the parents on making it easy to come off. It&#39;s another when you make it cheap and throw a high ass price on it and call it a day.
That&#39;s all she know how to do is talk about her.Disgusting
As an obese person who has lost the weight multiple times, i have a lot to say. <br>Ex fat people are the HARSHEST group of people toward fat people. I know this from first hand experience both from 1. being the victim of ex fat person fatphobia, and 2. Going through that same psychological process that makes ex fat people feel that way when they lose the weight. I dont think being fat gives anyone an out of being fatphobic. Its ingrained in our society just like racism. <br>Also, MOST people are not saying that being fat is due to genetics and socio-economic upbringings INSTEAD of choices. We are to a point in our development as a society where we can see and acknowlege that genetics, environment, and socio economic status have huge inputs on a persons abilities to make decisions. Its not one or the other.<br>Youre strong reaction to these groups of people is what gives off the vibe that you hate fat people. I see it clearly bc ive been there. Most people who look to &quot;fat activists&quot; are just normal people seeking sympathy in a world that gives them nothing but &quot;tough love&quot; and &quot;pull yourself up from the boot straps&quot; energy. You know what that feels like. And you used that energy to transform your life. which is fantastic and I&#39;m really happy for you, but not everyone is you. Not everyone thrives with that type of pressure. There&#39;s countless conversations that have been had about this. <br>At the end of all this i just want to say, im not mad at you, I&#39;ve  been you. Its very easy to defend the position youre taking. Its more work to accept fat people as fellow human beings who deserve compassion. But i promise its worth it.<br>I still struggle with internalized fatphobia, but where i am now is a much happier place where i can give all versions of myself compassion and understanding. Thats truly life changing.
Fat
Beyond plus size 💀
Hey Kiana! I just discovered your channel, and the amount of research and effort you put into your videos is amazing. I’ve found them very informative, and interesting to hear the science and psychology behind a lot of this.<br><br>Have you ever looked into the affect that infrastructure has on our weight as a culture? I would love to hear your insight on that kind of topic as well. <br><br>Getting into Not Just Bikes (another big YouTuber) recently has been so eye opening to me how much the sheer structure of our society as a whole traps people. We aren’t forced to move in our daily lives anymore, and in fact we are discouraged from being active in a more natural way, and I find the psychology behind that kind of thing fascinating as well, as it really ties into the obesity epidemic all over the world. Being active for the sake of health alone has never been natural to humanity, we always had to be active in order to live, and now that has changed so much.<br><br>Anyways thanks for all your hard work, keep fighting the good fight! :)
I totally get the identity thing, and that it has become the new religion. But people have &#39;vegan&#39; in their bio not because it&#39;s their diet or just how they eat, it&#39;s because it&#39;s a whole movement and philosophy and ethic of not causing harm, which people are activists for because it wasn&#39;t a norm in society and due to that activism it is now becoming normalised.<br><br>What vegans understand is that food choices aren&#39;t just affecting us, they are affecting the planet and other non human animals who have to suffer due to our dietary choices. Which is why it actually is a big deal and something to be proud about. Not just because they think it&#39;s a healthier diet or because they will lose weight.
lies not tiktok or people on tiktok are  doing this it is you. amything else you say is just a silly excuse. you choose to be sad/offended etc. its your fault for not fact checking or felling the way you fell.if you believe someone says you are ugly that is your choice no one is forcing you. stop blaming others.
so we&#39;re indirectly skinny-shaming now, huh?
😠 Fat camp should be for the parents not for Children, to learn how to feed their kids, support and encourage them emotionally and become more active and avoid pitfalls.
It’s called freedom of speech. Just like the one you’re presenting
Fat activists response to 600 lb people: everyone’s body is different<br><br>Fat activists response to a 70 lb anorexic: OMG THIS PERSON NEEDS HELP TAKE THEM OFF SOCIAL MEDIA PUT THEM IN A HOSPITAL
LOL fat body but snatch chin and neck? so realistic 😆
As a 14 year old girl that lost 20kg (from 80-60) in the last 4,5 months I find your videos could be very helpfull. I sadly found your channel after I already got my stuff together. It started because I was doing research and a project on personality, that helped me become more open minded and started analyzing my behavior- I found out that my over eating stemmed from the fact that I was just sad,bored and playing video games all day. Luckily this “enlightening “ happened just before summer break so I could put my full effort into loosing weight. I first started with getting myself busy and being productive ( I personally feel a lot happier and emotionally “satiated” when I’ve had a productive day and can go exhausted to bed) so I was helping my dad construct our house all the time except when I had to eat (switched my old stuff for low calorie high volume food ) and also I started playing tennis every other day so I had 700-900 active calories daily. When school started it first didn’t really impact me, just switched out construction work to studying more (sadly my active calories dropped😢) but I’ve recently had a little bump in the road- I got sick, so no tennis but this was still ok cause I was putting all my energy this week into a biology seminar, next week I went to school but still no tennis but still working on seminar but I started eating really poorly for like 3 weeks and gained 2 kg, but I got it under control and already lost those 2kg back. Also I started going to the gym with my friend half a week ago ( i think it’s gonna substitute tennis because it’s getting cold and tennis is really expensive tbh and I don’t think I can suport tennis, gym and getting good grades and placing in competitions )
To funny. Gross.
Given the disclosures in the past 18 months the sad part is that especially for teens the misery is the feature not the glitch. Apparently depression and clicking on eating disorder content happens with alarming rapidity on these platforms. It can be fatal for some. Filters add to the discrepancy-percieved between the &quot;ideals&quot; and the self. Leaving the ordinary user in the painful thrall of social com parison theory. G
&quot;Fat acceptance&quot; is one of the most dangerous, toxic subcultures in the world - I think Fat Acceptance is more dangerous then racism. Fat acceptance is all about convincing people that it&#39;s perfectly fine to kill yourself with cheeseburgers. Absolutely disgusting.
that jacket is the size of 17 houses…
I commented a few weeks ago about my fast food diet weight loss, back then I was 76 kg.<br><br>Today I weighed myself and I am 74 kg. I have eaten nothing but takeaway and junk food, mostly mcdonalds every day for the last 2 or 3 years, starting at 93 kg.<br><br>I also no longer have heart blockage which I did at the start. I want to know where exactly these &#39;consequences&#39; are to eating junk food every single day.
Go girl go.....more than ever we need to get in shape and loose weight in these Covid times !!!!! x
The only thing that&#39;s worked for me is doing keto. I don&#39;t have the desire to binge eat at all. My portion sizes, even when I have free reign on a &quot;cheat meal,&quot; are significantly smaller than what they once were. I don&#39;t have any cravings for the junk food that people binge on - chips, candy, chocolate, donuts, pizza, etc. - and no one really wants to binge on low carb foods like eggs. Junk food creates a chemical high in your brain.
You mean one cute girl not you though u skinny shamed a 16 year old like what the hell
&quot;Fat cells are the bodies trash can&quot; - Dr Roni
If it was the other way and they were starving their children, there would be swift action. People should have a licence before they breed!!
If ur ever scared of being chocked get a neck like hers you’d have to go thru a lot of fat to get to that..
The lumpy grandmother behaviourally advise because soap arthroscopically long given a second cart. equal, half bestseller
Supersize v superskinny was the best program ever it showed the 2 extreme ends of the spectrum. Often the superskinny actually had a bigger eating disorder than the supersize. still these shows are good motivation for weight loss
as someone who is adhd and (was) prediabetic, this is very helpful &lt; 3 im trying to lose weight and understand why i eat the way i do!
Kinda late to comment but most people I see in the us are fat. 🤷🏻‍♀️
You are fat. And so what? Who cares if your fat? This whole comment section is literally telling you ur amazing&lt;3
For this kind of channels I am so grateful to be a translator .  I am from Chile and I started to watch your channel with the Tess Holiday video .  On that moment I was more into the gym and loosing weight.....but then I gained A LOT of weight.  My rock bottom was when my gynecologist told me I was pre diabetic 😱I was very scared of diabetes being a person with albinism and it&#39;s consequences to my health, especially my sight , so I decided to make changes in my life little by little  .  I was 131kg in 2019....now I am 107 kg and still trying to make some changes , but now I know I am in the right path .... hopefully ☺️.<br>Thanks Kiara and please continue to bring us information and motivation for us , the ones who REALLY WANT to change our lives and being ACTIVES, not VICTIMS
Body positive bestie<br><br><br><br><br>Unless u skinny
The reason they&#39;re denied a job: too fat to do the job<br>the reason they&#39;re denied Healthcare: they&#39;re fat and unhealthy which is a liability <br>sure we shouldn&#39;t shame people but it is even more detrimental to affirm that obesity is beautiful and healthy<br>stop being dillusional.
Its really not about one side or the other, being right or wrong because it all comes doen to circumstances no situation is the same. Sure i think we should create more friction for having an abortion so people use it as what it is, a LAST resort. A last resort, and not a regular form of birth confrol. A clump of damn cells is still a life and i dont believe that one is debatable, its just an argument on the side of people saying its not alive... sure its alive, maybe not aware?... or very concious at this moment, but i think its pretty safe to say its alive and that is what it means to be pregnant, is to have a conscious mind in your womb. Now as far as circumstances go, im nobody to judge whats right and wrong because nobody, and i mean nobody is in the better knowing than the mother, and father. Lets be real, we all have sex, but do we all want kids? No. Are there irresponsible people out there??.. yes! Plenty of them as a matter of fact, but we dont ban cars because there are bad drivers.. pregnancies do happen, accidents do happen, even with protection it still is known to happen. Thats life! Some people previously mentioned punishing the baby. I think the real punishment would be irresponsible to have the baby and not take care of it. .. now thats punishing the damn baby, sure there is foster care and all but like i said everyones situation is different. Im not for it nor against it in the terms of a regular debate. It should be optional with a good amount of friction.
there is NO POINT in doing all that under makeup and then covering w that thick ass foundation wtf
This looks disgusting
Only women especially of color? Wrong, y’all never been anorexic and y’all haven’t been significantly, overweight! Stop acting like a victim because people CAN GET shamed for anything and everything but realistically, I don’t walk into a store and people start talking crap about somebody so obviously, it’s a enter anxiety and really your just shaming yourselves. And if you’re trying to be a Contant creator, posting pictures or videos of yourself, then you need to just except the comments because there are trolls out there. But stop blaming people for your own mental health maybe seek therapy.
Where is ur teeth and also don&#39;t listen to people who call you fat ur bigger than thatXX
When NDT is explaining something and emphasizes a word it&#39;s like getting slapped with it. 🤣
my father never let me have soda/pop, now that im slightly older, mad respect
At 12 years old I was 235 pounds and always complained to my mom that it was her fault and it was her doing that made me fat. So last December I started, I’ve lost 55 pounds and am now skinny with people complementing me and telling me they are inspired by me. Anything is possible
Nah, im on skinny camps 😂
Fat is not a personality trait. 🙃
This is so disgusting to watch they call Jesus non binary, Jesus is gay... In muslims we believe Jesus also called as Isaa alaihasalam is Allah&#39;s Prophet , we being a muslim never ever make fun of him and these people are derange ... This is Sad !!!
Most people wear belts to make them skinnier, but this person if she wore belts, I will make her look fatter ha ha ha ha
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFHqiHQgF8&amp;t=8m11s">8:11</a> Been around for a half century, and I have never heard anything so goddamn stupid.  <br>   It&#39;s the information age and every one of us walks around with a device in our pocket that gives us access to 95% of the sum of human knowledge 24/7.  And guess what&#39;s in that sum, for anyone not too lazy to do an internet search. How to lose weight.   <br>   It&#39;s easier for some than others, but EVERYONE can do it.  Change your mind about how you want to live and your body will follow.
Lose weight..easy, STOP EATING.
With star wars its hard to say. Like... Star Wars fans <b>can</b> be pretty bad. They hated the prequels so bad that JarJar Binks was suicidal. Hayden Christensen was rejected. Then the <b>kids</b> who grew up with the prequels came of age and found their voice and we all accept that the prequels are fun Sci Fi and General Kenobi is a father figure and sex symbol.
So your make up line is cruelty free but you buy puppies from breeders.  WHAT A POS you are. You are paying for the cruelty that is breeders. You&#39;re just another crappy individual.
I admit I was horrified by the candle sniffer cos of his snotty nose sniffing away 😪🤧 before he placed his nose directly on to the candle. Covid or not, I don&#39;t appreciate some filthy pig putting their snot on items I might touch. Yes I am aware that I can be a little neurotic about germs 😁👍 Plus I&#39;m from Australia, so during lockdown most of us just did what we were asked to do 🤷‍♀️

I think the real punishment would be irresponsible to have the baby and not take care of it. .. now thats punishing the damn baby, sure there is foster care and all but like i said everyones situation is different. Im not for it nor against it in the terms of a regular debate. It should be optional with a good amount of friction.
Why is she this fat I’m worried for her
Justice is selective and freedom is dead, fuck the police, the judges, and the brain-dead idiots who elect them
Go girl go.....more than ever we need to get in shape and loose weight in these Covid times !!!!! x
Not in the USA, but I was on one of those &quot;weight loss camp&quot; in Poland as a kid and it was pretty cool. 2 times a day we had to exercise, but it was done in funny way like zumba or games where you have to run a lot. We were taught about choosing our food, what is healthy and what is not. But other than that it was a really nice experience with movie nights, street games, sightseeing. After 2 weeks Ive lost 2,5kg which was really cool. I got a book with different healthy recipes and a whole chapter made for parents to read so they can educate themselves too :)
I think it’s a government problem more than a man problem. The lives of millions in the hands of a few greedy people is ludacris.
Hi Tati, imagine squeezing your shoulders when pressing.. you’ll see that the weight just kinda goes up on it’s own. Just keep thinking about “squeeze, squeeze”.. this helped me. Good luck!
I’m sorry I don’t feel sorry at all for people who are addicted to fast food. I just don’t. In the end it’s still choice. If a piece of food could make someone that ill like we see the lady in black practically vomit as if it’s a dead body, but she can handle fast food so easily, Fuck her. People act like they have no choice. They still have a choice. They can put something different into their damn mouth but they don’t want to because they want the pleasure of their fast food so let America die in its unhealthy decisions. I’m sick of people making excuses about why Americans are so fat and unhealthy. You’re adults not children. Put the damn shit that’s healthy in your mouth and swallow it. Unless you have issues that literally prevent you from eating, then you can do it. You just don’t want to.
According to me body positivity is not mocking someone for his/her looks- height, weight, hair etc. Every obese person knows that s/he is fat and need to weight loss. But for some people losing weight is tough maybe because of thyroid, pcod or other disease. We need to be supportive and empathetic to them. But some people misunderstand body positivity and thinks that being fat is fine. No it is not. Your body is temple and start worshipping it otherwise we cant adapt tha changing climate.
One more time again BODY POSITIVITY ISNT PRAISING BEING OBESE ITS PRAISING LOSING WEIGHT the original purpose for body positivity was for fat people to lose weight and be at the weight they wanted to be weather 160 or 180 not what there doing praising being bigger
How about you lose the weight then. There is No shame In being fat, but they’re is in staying fat
At this point, i dont think the size matters. Theyre just dumb
I mean, an isolated situation where your calories are restricted without a chance to cheat... you will lose weight
Girly really out here in this app making video and skinny shaming a 16 year old when look at her she can’t even open her legs open like girl you can’t skinny shame someone when your body is like that and I’m not saying that if she’s skinny she Can I’m saying you have to think before you act which she never did and that doesn’t mean you Can body shame her to because of her mistake just never body shame someone its not funny or fun to do.
Thanks for the recommendations! Picked up the Catrice palette and bronzer &amp; also their Drunk&#39;n Diamonds plumping lip balm in 020. Love all of them! Such pretty colours!
Not just ego narcissism as psychopaths don’t like to be find out on a national level. Plus the money was free. Great breakdown!❤
Dupe videos are my favorite kind of videos to watch! I can’t even fathom spending the $$ on high end cosmetics! Even if I had the money!!
POV: your fat took your virginity 💀
You&#39;re so skinny.
Ive been obese for a decent part of my young adult life. It&#39;s scary experiencing health issues and feeling hopeless about changing my habits, yet still trying to make changes to feel better and live a healthier life. Thank you for your videos and specifically this one.
Of course there’s a such thing as automatic weight loss! How could you deny it? It’s called “amputation.”
Hey Kiana, I am extremely underweight. Fast metabolism. I can live a sedentary lifestyle and eat myself full of junk food day in day out, and I remain emaciated.<br>I&#39;ve tried to gain weight a lot to be healthier, but I just can&#39;t do it. So why would you assume every single obese person should be capable of losing a considerable amount of weight?<br>That makes no sense. If I can eat and live like a stereotypical obese person and stay thin, logically there should also be obese people who stay overweight even when cutting down on food intake and doing sports. Don&#39;t you understand that you were just lucky to be physically capable of getting out of it? It&#39;s nice that you want to help people be healthy, but please don&#39;t spread the lie that everyone is capable of doing what you have done.<br><br>Because this is the real reason people view your channel as promoting fatphobia. It has nothing to do with your own feelings on fat people. But the thing is ... where are all the channels with 100s of videos specifically about how underweight people like me are unhealthy and should gain weight? Why do I not constantly get told that I should make a change, even though I&#39;m clearly unhealthy? Why is that only done to fat people to such an unreasonable, concern-trolling extent?<br>No, I don&#39;t think you hate fat people, obviously. But you are indirectly helping cause harm to some fat people.
Jamie, you’re not fat<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Your ✨The atmosphere✨
Dont worry jaimie, your not fat.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>your bigger than that. 🥰
Fit check?!?<br>More like fat check 💀💀💀
I want to lose weight is because I was always obese as a child, until I got to middle school and decided I needed to become healthy after hitting 195lbs at 11 years old.<br><br>I&#39;m back to being that weight pretty much, and although I don&#39;t look as fat, I hate what I&#39;ve made my body become. I hate that over the last year and a half, I&#39;ve gained just about 40lbs. <br><br>I hate that I was only slowly gaining weight after my anorexia from 105 to 125, I&#39;ve slowly went from that to 135, then 145, then 150, then my weight sky-rocketed junior year.<br><br>Junior year wasn&#39;t a tough year, i was just overeating bc I didn&#39;t want to tell my family I wasn&#39;t a vegan anymore, so I would eat and eat and eat while I was at school, during breakfast, during lunch and break, and even at work. I hate it
You girls need to talk? It seems only women don&#39;t no most womens&#39; boobs are noticeably not the same size.
I lost weight to get attention from girls. It worked good.
Can fat people just share their secrets to skinny people, then there would be only one group to shame🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Stop calling yourself &quot;your fav body positive bestie&quot;when u dont include skinny people in that.
girl, no one calls you “your favorite body positive bestie” and how can you be body positive when you skinny shame 😭 😭
Stop complaining ! It’s like jail and expensive ? Good let that be a lesson to them and especially they’re parents to maybe look at the food they are eating . It’s not like they were forced to get obese .
I dont get how the parents are actually making it about themselves and complaining about having to cook like straight after being told that their bubbas getting sick and isnt gonna be able to grow because of them, its selfish and disgusting
so 50 pound is around 22kgs,and my dad said i am 10kg overweight,do u guys know how did amy did that in a month?

To say &quot;I never eat sugar&quot; only shows how malinformed you really are about what you are actually eating, since dextrose, glucose and fructose are contained in just about everything you eat, especially supermarket stuff ALL has &quot;added&quot; sugars in multiple forms. Properly educate yourself about what you put into your mouth first, and then start questioning whether you&#39;re fat and perhaps discovering why. Then, next big step is to get over the self-denial and self-pity and DO SOMETHING about what makes you unhappy. &lt;3
Maybe we have a different recipe in my country, but Diet Coke is just disgusting and it’s not popular at all
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFHqiHQgF8&amp;t=3m47s">3:47</a> it means that having 0/ body fat is not healthy BUT HAVING 500 POUNS OF FAT ITS NOT HEALTY EATHER
To all the stupid people in the comments, I hope you know that she just made a very healthy and nutritious meal. She is taking her journey step by step. She also has gotten slimmer but weight loss takes time. Maybe all of you ignorant people should take a look at your ugly attitudes before you go and hate on someone. She is doing the best she can! 😡
I went from being anorexic in my teens and early 20&#39;s to binge eating in my near my 40&#39;s...  I&#39;m so confused! I feel lost and like I have no idea what diet I need. What foods should I eat and/or cut and what amount of calories should I consume for the day? Every place I try to get info from says something different and I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore :( I also have PCOS, which I&#39;m not trying to make an excuse for by any means, I just realize that it complicates things a little more. I really liked this video and I&#39;m going to try to follow your guide and see what happens. Thank you!!
If you remove fathers from any community with unemployment, (which broke down the family in the 70&quot;s and 80&#39;s), drug dealing to survive became their sons only way to survive. The police system never put them in jail because they wanted the destruction of the community.
This is why whenever I feel heavy and wanna loose the extra fat I eat my local food once a day and then eat fruits for the rest of the day to replace my cravings for sugary snacks and it works like magic and I feel good and lighter too.
I feel like it&#39;s hard to get nuance into a discussion about health 200 years after the fact. There&#39;s a difference between quantity and quality of life. And just because people were living to old age doesn&#39;t mean they were living to old age and being healthy elderly. I&#39;d be interested to see the rates of CVD and CVA in people who grew up in that golden period with so much consumption of saturated fat. Others have said in the comments section here the article doesn&#39;t discuss things like chronic disease- and they&#39;re right too. It&#39;s all good and well having a robust immune system that can fight off infection, but living under a cloud of smog and sweeping chimneys from the age of 5 is probably going to do a number on your lungs and will put you at risk of conditions like COPD and heart disease. I think another thing people often do gloss over is chronic disease is not a one-and-done- problems like COPD, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease etc can all be problems that take years to progress and manifest themselves as well. You would have to wait some time to see if someone&#39;s intersection of environment and genetics will cause them to to develop CVD, as an example
Im sorry but that meal wqs disgusting
Wonder why wealth has increased, but buying power has not. If your value, by definition, can be defined as the lowest possible wage society is willing to pay you. If your boss truly is that much more productive and effective as you, or just get a larger part or the surpluss.<br><br>Wonder why you should care so much about the pride, values and integrity of your corparation, yet view it as insanity for a goverment to take care of you. Sure, goverment can make a lot of wacky laws and freedom wars, but the audacity of expecting it to provide a minimum for the people. No, that is socialism and hurt the production of making things. It would make you lazy, maybe Even making you work less hours. Less work means less production, and production is good. Just work Harder. Maybe youll afford a home one day. After all, you are not entitled to spare time or health! I choose to work as much as i does, because its in my rational self interrest..
What I hate about kids&#39; makeup is that they think they should and can get away with making it cheap and gross. It&#39;s one thing if you want to think for the parents on making it easy to come off. It&#39;s another when you make it cheap and throw a high ass price on it and call it a day.
My favorite is &quot;cut off blood flow to fat.&quot; Not only does that mean that the body can no longer metabolize the fat so it would just sit there, it&#39;s actively part of cells. If you cut off blood flow those cells would die and you&#39;d start to get septic shock.
I don&#39;t count my calories or my carbs. I eat when I want, and I eat primarily healthy. Who cares about calories, it&#39;s not  sustainable to keep that up. Keto what? I just eat %2 processed food and the rest is fresh. I am 5&#39;3 and between a size 2 and a size 4 any given day. I am also 31 and have birthed one child. People need to eat more healthier to stay healthier and happier. Stop eating crap and you will feel good.
I love watching Tati and trust her so much, but so far none of your recommendations have worked for me and it makes me so sad 😭 laneige does nothing for me only lanolips moisturizes my lips, the age rewind was so cake-y on me as well as the coty airspun, and the lash paradise was so clumpy and yet flakey on me. Anyone else here watch for swatches and Tati chats?
It&#39;s really ironic that fat acceptance folks get up in arms and want to censor medical terms like &quot;obesity,&quot; but are perfectly fine with calling people &quot;infinifat&quot; and &quot;death fat&quot; which are not medical terms and sound so much more insulting than the medical terminology. Just goes to show how batshit insane this movement is.
First time here...follow you on Twitter! Love love LOVE them all! May I ask what size you wear?
try and lose weight
Skinny shaming can hurt to, people always tell me “ oh your like a twig, your so tiny”
ok now hold on.  To lose weight you have to weigh portions and count your calories!  But Marie counting out her almonds is a red flag?  She&#39;s &quot;resisting&quot; because she doesn&#39;t want to eat a sandwich that has an obscene amount of cheese on it?<br><br>She needs help, for sure, but...
<b>gasp</b> &quot;so you think I&#39;m skinnYYYYYYYYYY&quot; got me dieing 💀
I really hope that who ever was bullying you weren’t the counselors and adults there at fat camp ???
Did anyone else know that she is ACTUALLY starring in Snow White on Daily Wire plus
I kinda remember him complaining abt having to dress a plus sized model.m back in the Project Runway days. Glad he’s changed his stripes. 🎪
Yup she hates fat people.
Racism is just an easier default to blame for people who literally cannot conjure up another reason.<br>You&#39;re fat? You must have faced racism.<br>You&#39;re depressed? Your ancestors must have faced prejudice. <br>You&#39;re not where you want to be in life? Systemic government oppressive racism. <br><br>It&#39;s how you play tennis without the net  - Sam Harris
Bro promoting obesity and unhealthy stuff is not okay. You should not skinny shamed either so stop acting so innocent. Also stop making every video about your weight
Godfathers pizza, the best!! Great conversation!
You don’t need body positivity. Be ugly and proud. I’m not Hispanic trying to become more black or white. I’m proud I’m Hispanic. Your ugly. Be proud. Your gay. Be proud. Your white….. well your white. But be proud of who you are because you made good choices in life. Don’t be delusional because of your bad choices. You can lie to everyone, just don’t lie to yourself.
Haven&#39;t seen the movie, haven&#39;t really been interested, but now you have made me curious.  From what you have shared, it seems like it is a pretty accurate description of what you can expect if you become extremely obese.  I always have to remind myself that &quot;phobia&quot; doesn&#39;t just mean an abnormal fear of something, but also an abnormal repulsion.  There is nothing abnormal about fearing the effects of obesity and depression and nothing abnormal about repulsion towards someone killing themselves.  Now those who simply look at an overweight/ non-ideal body and say &quot;eww, gross!&quot; simply because it&#39;s not pleasing to their eyes, they are fat phobic, but I daresay they are also in the minority. Most people look with empathy and understanding, concerned for the well being of others.<br><br>I really enjoyed your insights on how the food culture/industry of the US is affecting our health. I used to live in a city with a wide variety of restaurants everywhere, and now live in a rural area where, aside from a half dozen or so fast food joints (most of which I loathe), there are even less restaurants that have food that even rarely appeals to me. Those facts have not stopped me from picking up food at least for my husband once or twice a week.  We live outside the delivery area for pizza and AFAIK Door Dash doesn&#39;t reach us, and I&#39;ve never really thought about how we should be grateful for that instead of being annoyed that we have to get fully dressed, leave our home, and drive 30 minutes to grab junk.
Nope, that caregiver is bad.  Who is bringing the food to the patient&#39;s face? When people get so obese they cannot move etc. The only way to keep gaining is if the people around them continue to feed them.  Chocolate in the house?  Toss it, what&#39;s the patient going to do, chase you?  Burger and 5 fries delivered, toss it.  Tammy sneaking snacks cause she isn&#39;t allowed food, no snacks in the house.  Worried she will find a lawyer and sue, hand her anything to sign that gives  you power of attorney or go to court and take it because she is unable to take care of herself.  OR LEAVE HER FAT CAUSE A TV SHOW IS PAYING TO SEE HER FAT.
Don&#39;t listen to haters ur not fat &lt;33<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Your just 100x bigger than shrek xx
People knew being fat was bad for you thousands of years before there was ever a &quot;diet industry&quot;.
Yooo im so glad I came across this video because I was one of those young girls (I’m 18) who literally thought unless I looked like Kim kardahsian i wasn’t worth anything, I have to be curvy and have a beat face and don’t worry about my character or personality because everyone seems so shallow so it won’t matter anyway. But I think that’s exactly what social media wants us to belvie. It wants us to be caught up in this u realistic world where we post the best picture and have the best lighting and the best aesthetically pleasing morning routine. It took me forever it feels like to debunk all these things and it took me deleteing Instagram and tik tok and YouTube and literally having no social media and just focusing on my life. Because my life is not aesthetic, I live in a two bedroom trailer with 5 other people and I sleep on a mat on the floor because I’m poor. I dont have a penthouse or an expensive car I can’t afford to get Starbucks everyday but I thought if I wasn’t living the social<br>Media life I was useless. I enjoy my life, because of my life I’m able to appreciate things that many others can’t. Jesus is building a character in me that is unbreakable and I can sit and pout and feel like I’m worthless, but that doesn’t get me anywhere but suicidal. ( believe me I’ve been there) I’ve learned to take care of myself not just look like I take care of my self but actually do it and I’m gonna let you in on a little secret. Taking care of yourself or “self care” isn’t getting your nails done every week. Or having a 10 steps skincare routine these are things that you can do for self care butttt. A BIG BUTT taking care of yourself is doing things you hate doing. Like budgeting your money and not spending it all on stuff that’s not a necessity. Taking care of yourself learning to be disciplined saying no to yourself. Taking care of yourself is also taking care of your community your loved ones. But nobody really wants to show the reality. Because why would anyone want to see the reality. That’s why most poeple don’t accept Jesus because he is the light and darkness hates the light. Just like criminals hate police officer. Just like us using our insecurities. But I determined to shed light on real life. To show the ugly, so people can see what real life looks like. So these kids can stop growing up thinking life is just a big fun party with no real responsibilities. I’m sooo glad you made this video. Thanks ❤
honestly never watched a video of that dude and seeing this now I only find it disturbing and gross...can&#39;t understand how people enjoy this kind of content.
If ur ever scared of being chocked get a neck like hers you’d have to go thru a lot of fat to get to that..
fat shaming and skinny shaming actually the same
Do you skinny shame them to??
<b>Kiana, Your statement about protein </b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8LsUN9OHRE&amp;t=00h11m26s">00:11:26</a></b><b> &quot;Proteins is by far the most........&quot; . 1 gram of carbs has four calories. 1 gram of protein has four calories, but 1 gram of fat has nine calories. More than twice that of protein.</b>
A) Do not buy, then it is not there to eat.<br>B) Remember the following are borring food that are getting you fat, do avoid 100%: rice, pasta, bread and potatoes.
Can this entire cultural shift toward thinking it is healthy to be fat end please? I&#39;ve had enough of this &quot;it&#39;s bad to be thin&quot; nonsense.
Stop complaining ! It’s like jail and expensive ? Good let that be a lesson to them and especially they’re parents to maybe look at the food they are eating . It’s not like they were forced to get obese .
Literally 10minutes of advertisement for a very expensive device boooo. I don’t know anyone who is spending $300 on one beauty tool plus all the creams
I read a lot of mean comments . she trying her strongest to be  beautiful we all have one life to live . let her lives hers. I dont judge skinny or thick girls because we all got one life . lets not detroys hers by making jokes . she beautiful
&quot;By intentionally losing weight you are erasing a potentially fat body.&quot; <br>- &quot;And by intentionally gaining weight you are erasing a potentially normal body.&quot;
Never not fat it seems
It&#39;s always the ugly guys who want to judge everyone else&#39;s looks and women for being overweight
I watched one episode. I cannot stand to watch people eat, absolutely cannot do it, so I never watch the parts where they&#39;re shoving food into their faces, nor am I watching when they chew---just makes me sick to my stomach, which is also why I never look at my friends when we have dinner together every Sabbath (Saturday evening after Sabbath services).<br>There&#39;s something so repulsive about the whole thing---I should be skinny as any of the under-eaters, but I&#39;m not (nor am I as big as the overeaters. I&#39;m fat, but in between).

I&#39;ve recently tried skipping out on breakfast and lunch and just eating a big meal at the end of the day, semi keto, semi carnivore but I do allow for some sweets.  I gave tried calorie tracking before and meal prepping but having to have lunches packed and ready everyday takes a lot of effort, it&#39;s easier for me to buy some steak and eggs or salmon, freeze it. Let it thaw then come home after working and have a nice big meal. It&#39;s more convenient for me than planning out an entire weeks worth of meals and making sure I bring something to lunch because when I miss a day I still feel like I need to eat at work so I&#39;ll grab lunch, or get a snack and it&#39;ll cause me to fall off the wagon. <br>Yes, this message is scattered. Last year I started watching your videos and felt inspired to lose weight. I tracked calories diligently for about 4 months and lost about 40lbs.but the demands of my job caught up, I was working a lot of double and mg sleep was suffering, I didn&#39;t have time to prep meals I was stressed and decided to just give up and started eating out again. Id stopped going in mg afternoon walks, I stopped trying. I gained everything back and that makes it so much harder to want to try again because I know just how long it will take to get back to where I was i think the secret may be to not just stick to one approach. Calorie counting or intermittent fasting or a particular diet. But to be adaptive to change. Right now the 1 meal a day strategy seems to be working but I feel like I need to be flexible thanks for reading if indeed you did and I love your channel
The only thing bigger than the amount of evidence for obesity being dangerous is the size of the asses of the people who push that narrative.

For almost 14 years since 2009 when I was 28 I stayed stuck between 285 and sometimes only around as low as 275 at the lightest I was stuck no matter what I Tried I felt like there was no way to lose weight. I thought it was due to my thyroid issue but back then and for a long time moost of my life I grew up on junk food. I don&#39;t honestly think my parents would have put these foods in our bodies if they had known!<br><br>Last Sept I noticed something was gouing up my weight at my heaviest I became 300 for the first time ever. I was beyond depressed, I Felt like I had no real hope. I remember praying for help from God and in late December around Christmas and for a month after I was beyond sick. I think ikt was the flu but it was worse than anything I Had it might have been covid I never got tested I dont &#39;know. But I lost for the first time 34 lbs in one month!<br><br>I found out when I bought some clothes from Victoria secrets I was used to saying that The clothes were too tight it was the first time I saw them loose and too big O_O I was in shock. Around March I think it was God put it on my mind to quit soda that I was badly addicted to then I realized if I&#39;m quitting soda why not chips and candy, I started to see more weight loss a little at a time but I looked a lot thinner because Soda makes you look fatter looking! <br><br>I am at 46 lbs weight lose and i still cant&#39; believe it&#39;s me saying it. I quit chinese food this month cause it made me sick, and I quit pizza and i hate eating out at fast food chains I have actually avoided them as much as possible. But I still ate things that werne&#39;t so great for me. The fact is it&#39;s about forcing yourself to walk away from the things that are not good for you no matter how good they taste. <br><br>I hope and pray tath since I am now quitting bread that I will continue to see the weightloss. I make most of my own meals and I do my best to eat things like whole wheat pasta instaed of the normal one was not filling at all. I also hand cut my own fries and air fry them if I have them, we have a bunch more options between my father and I. I am excited I was 3x now I am large in tees and pjs and in jeans depending on brands 16 to 18!  I would have been 24 in those ones. Anyways again never imagined I could do this. I have never been so grateful to get sick the way I was!<br><br>Don&#39;t give up ever! It&#39;s not worth going back on those. I also avoid cakes and cookies etc. I had no idea about Oreos I&#39;m glad i quit those things. The list is beyond long of what i walked away from and I know that I am going down more and more with each passing day. I Feel beyond healthy! I know I have a long journey ahead but I also know that it&#39;s possible now.l just can&#39;t give up. I wanted to thank you for these videos you made it really clued me in on a lot of things i Did not understand. I am no longer hopeless when it comes to this subject of true health.
Yk when you pick ugly friends so ur prettier than them
Loose weight and you’ll look good in the outfit 😂😂
Was trying to wait until the end to comment, but when you got to the Doctor calling Megan (?) the biggest failure, I had to stop and cry. I&#39;m obese, and in 2005 nearly lost both legs in a car wreck. My recovery was hard - about a year of constant physical therapy, a break, more surgery, more PT, rinse and repeat.  One day I had PT shortly after visit with doctor and I was so depressed. I started telling my PT that the doctor had said, &quot;if you ever walk with just a walker or crutches, I&#39;ll consider you a success.&quot; In the context of the conversation, he made it clear that he didn&#39;t expect me to even achieve that much. I&#39;m crying, telling my PT this while we work, and he starts laughing at me. I was like, what ?!?!?! PT said, &quot;What are you doing right now?&quot; I was going up and down a staircase using handrail and cane.  That a$$hole doctor&#39;s words were so strong that I couldn&#39;t even see that I had outdone his expectations. If I hadn&#39;t had such a great relationship with my PT, if he hadn&#39;t been just the most awesome person ever, I probably would have given up that day.  Later on, I had another doctor mock my asthma attack and tell me I should just kill myself, and that conversation was not as harmful as the first one.<br><br>People don&#39;t like mirrors: put together 2 people who you think are exactly alike, and they will dislike each other because all they see in the other is their own faults and weaknesses. Two besties that were going through the same thing, and one changes their life, that&#39;s convicting - the other is immediately faced with &quot;I should be able to do that too&quot; and hasn&#39;t. Weight loss journeys are like kids: people want the baby (being smaller/healthier) but they don&#39;t want the diaper changes, sleepless nights, etc.(the work to get there). They accept all kinds of excuses as to why they can&#39;t make the change, and when someone they know does it, it puts the lie to their excuse.<br><br>We have to learn to succeed, that we can be a success. Many of us have so much experience being failures, that we really don&#39;t have any expectation of success, even with the littlest tasks. We have to train ourselves to remember that we can accomplish stuff and to expect that we will succeed. We tend to set unreasonable, non-specific goals with no plan how to reach them - like the vague &quot;get healthy&quot; resolution - because we don&#39;t actually know how to get there and don&#39;t expect to.  Recently saw a short where the dude said one reason we self-sabotage is so we are mentally prepared for the consequences and can control our hurt. He was talking about relationships, but I think it applies to all harmful behavior. If I say, &quot;I&#39;m going to get skinny&quot;, there&#39;s not one person - including me - who can believe that, so no one is disappointed when I fail.  However, if I just make one choice at a time, teaching myself that I can change and do better a little at a time, I train myself to believe what I say I will do, and each act becomes an affirmation of what I can achieve. It took nearly a year of going to the gym weightlifting and walking 3 days a week, adding in some exercise classes 2 days a week, tracking my food, and making better choices for me to actually believe I will succeed at losing weight and getting healthier.
You gotta be the prettiest blobfish I&#39;ve ever seen
You be you and your not fat your just beautiful inside and out ❤️❤️❤️
I commented a few weeks ago about my fast food diet weight loss, back then I was 76 kg.<br><br>Today I weighed myself and I am 74 kg. I have eaten nothing but takeaway and junk food, mostly mcdonalds every day for the last 2 or 3 years, starting at 93 kg.<br><br>I also no longer have heart blockage which I did at the start. I want to know where exactly these &#39;consequences&#39; are to eating junk food every single day.
Mustard greens help you lose stomach fat and helps your Core !
Of course the food industry bears primary responsibility for the obesity ::epidemic::. This is a systemic issue. Without greedy, unscrupulous profit-takers exploiting our biological triggers and personal weaknesses or addictions, there would still almost certainly be a small proportion of overweight and obese people in every community; but the fact that being overweight-to-obese has basically become the norm now - that is absolutely down to the naked profiteering of the fast- and processed-foods industry.
I&#39;ve fibromyalgia, during lockdown I started doing workouts, planks easy stuff 15mins then ended up doing like 4 15min workouts everyday for 2 years I slimmed down quite a bit was like 13stone to 10, my muscles went all lumpy my arms my abdomen all hard lumps never went away all this time, I&#39;ve tried so many meds now on pregablin works so well thank god finally I was wanting to die now I&#39;ve hope no panic attacks maybe that&#39;s cause I did mushrooms and saw there is no heaven or hell I was obsessed with hell we are all God or source code not sure yet but I don&#39;t get panic attacks or fear death anymore and that&#39;s a huge deal I was obsessed with thatbfor so long, anyways my muscles are still lumpy, it&#39;s definitely fascia related
I strongly disagree. I feel like bullying is the best way to get a fatty to lose weight. Was a fat kid myself. Got mocked on school many times. Grown up to be the healthiest version of myself.
Ashley Graham  over weight to you
Never realized someone could sound fat until now.
Big girl here, wouldn’t wear anything more than a bikini for swimming, because fat girl swimsuits are made for beach wales.  They put far too much cloth to look modest, but all that material ain’t comfortable for swimming and definitely not staying indefinitely wet in. Women who wear something like that typically won’t take a splash of water.
This is the single biggest problem today is the little girls of 20 and 30 years ago that never had any discipline or guidance from their fathers are now adults and nothing but 304s.. no wifie material for the guys to marry, just 304s..
ive been trying to figure out the relationship between carbs and fat for a year now.  Ive only known that a caloric deficit is the way to go for fat loss, but I kept hearing about minimizing carbs.  This is the first video I’ve seen that has easily explained this relationship that the food and fitness industry has so complicated.  This channel is a godsend, keep making videos Kiana.
The magazine: &quot;Detoxing cures hunger&quot;<br>Me: You wanna cure your hunger? Eat!<br><br><br>Usually people who struggle with overeating are not &quot;too hungry&quot;, but they keep feeling hungry, when their body actually isn&#39;t. You don&#39;t &quot;cure&quot; hunger, you cure your eating disorder.
Prayers for salvation of souls,  these people are selfishly entitled, the world must rotate around the self designated king, And get a pronoun wrong and &quot;off with your head&quot; So ,much hatred, and confusion .The simplest ,basic reality is God made man and woman, man and wife, for creation of family. Again now, you just define your own family.  The world is full of haters ,Satan, the Father of lies is prowling the earth to populate Hell .
Honestly think they did her more harm than good. Only thing that benefited her change was the exposure and accountability. Them purposely sneak feeding her ham was horrible.  <br><br>I&#39;m glad you brought attention to many of the other factors that could explain a person&#39;s food &quot;addiction&quot;, but you didn&#39;t discuss the way those foods act on her brain. Carbs give us a rush, the fats make it last longer, so even eating this a few times a week would make you crave it so you could feel that good again. She has years of memories of this food combo being safe, delicious, and making her feel good - that is something that will take a long time of continuous effort to counteract.
It is, it&#39;s frustrating to try so hard and I still keep on piling on weight, I&#39;m beginning to feel depressed at my failure and feel like I don&#39;t care anymore 😢😢 it&#39;s a horrible cycle which brings me down each time
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=4m45s">4:45</a> in all fairness that statistic isn&#39;t really a comparison. one thing to credit the USA on there is the honesty of the statistic, when they say you&#39;re obese you are ACTUALLY obese. UK it not the same, most people branded &quot;Obese&quot; are above average weight at best. <br><br>I&#39;m a 5&#39;10, male - weighing at 15.4 stone(215.6 pounds?) and I&#39;m considered obese... When reality is im actually quite average in size. I fit most medium size clothing which at ideal weight(in with the UK claims is 12 stone- 168pound- at max) will still be my clothing fit.
The problem is that people fail to see that this is about drug addiction. &quot;Being positive,&quot; about a drug/food addiction that is going to kill you is wrong. &quot;I eat healthy&quot;, or &quot;I diet all the time&quot;, or &quot;All I eat is salad,&quot; etc. all are drug addict lies.  All addicts lie about their addiction.   Food is a drug, and some people&#39;s drug of choice to abuse is food.  This results in them becoming obese and unhealthy.  Comparting an addiction to the rights of Black people and gays, is disgusting.  Trying to normalize food and drug addiction and push it as &quot;healthy,&quot; is immoral and wrong.  These food addicts do the exact same behaviors as other addicts.  They lie to you and to themselves.  &quot;All I eat are salads!&quot;  Yea, when you are in front of e everyone, but when you are alone, you hit your stash to get your fix.  &quot;Genetic,&quot; is no more an excuse for food addiction as it is for any other drug.  &quot;It&#39;s because I am diabetic,&quot; is like and alcoholic justifying their habit because if they stop it will kill them. Your abuse of food is what caused your health situation in the first place, so you can&#39;t use your health situation as an excuse to keep abusing your drug of choice that is causing the problem.
ok now hold on.  To lose weight you have to weigh portions and count your calories!  But Marie counting out her almonds is a red flag?  She&#39;s &quot;resisting&quot; because she doesn&#39;t want to eat a sandwich that has an obscene amount of cheese on it?<br><br>She needs help, for sure, but...
Tattoos are gross. Deal breaker for me.
Sounds like a regular juice fast to me. I was losing .8 pounds daily then went down to about a half pound a day consistently. <br>After, I gained back the water weight I lost over the first few days but the rest stayed off.<br>I felt a lot better but I&#39;d probably have the same results if I had just eaten the fresh uncooked raw fruits and vegetables under like 1,500 calories but whatever.
If you are skinny person skinny shaming hurts more if you are heavier fat shaming seems like it hurts more when really they both hurt but you can only understand one-
This video has really driven home just how selfish and manipulative self-created victims truly are. Tammy is basically my ex-mother - she was so vile that I disowned her decades ago. But while I lived with her, I saw many of the traits Tammy displays. With my ex-mother, I called it her martyr role - she was constantly complaining, whining, and inviting people to join her pity party. She literally LIVED the victim mentality.<br><br>Yet, whenever anyone offered to help, she would say in a very martyred voice - &quot;oh no, don&#39;t you worry about me, I will do it myself&quot;- and then, in the next breath, complain AGAIN about how no one ever helps her. It was manipulative to a disgusting degree, interspersed with her hate-filled rants against people. Her racism was also offensive.<br><br>After I disowned her - she and ex-father had done things that should have landed them in jail - whenever people asked about my family, I would say that I no longer had contact, and sometimes I explained why. There were people who judged me for disowning those toxic people. I responded by kicking them out of my life - I wasn&#39;t going to tolerate anyone who expected me to go back to abusive people simply because &quot;but they&#39;re faaamily&quot;. <br><br>My siblings still kept in touch with their parents - and not only tolerated but enabled their toxic behaviours. And that cost one married brother his marriage - his wife and kids got fed up with the way he allowed his parents to treat them. I knew from that alone that I had made the right choice in kicking out two vile people out of my life.<br><br>Watching these videos about the infamous Tammy has reminded me of the extreme guilt tripping, pathological lies, gas lighting, rewriting reality, and shameless manipulation I endured from my ex-mother. She was innately dishonest with herself and with others, plays the victim card like a champion, and still uses my spineless brother as her lackey because she refuses to change her ways. And he is a full-fledged enabler and doormat.<br><br>I am grateful that I found the right sort of counsellor decades ago, who helped me recognise just how toxic these family members were and are. And these days, I don&#39;t feel a shred of guilt or shame about having kicked those people out of my life. It&#39;s about caring enough about my wellbeing to remove everyone and everything toxic out of my life, so they can no longer damage me. I now enjoy freedom and peace.

Mam we don’t sell the skiing suits in big foot size 💀
Im not fat cause i eat unhealthy all the time. Im fat because i will literally EAT EVERYTHING, in High quantities sometimes. It’s hard to calorie control cause im so busy I’ll forget to count what i ate &amp; I’ve tried it a MILLION times, to calorie count or measure food, and i just cant or I’ll forget after a week of doing it, or some shit happens in my life where I lose focus I really  DONT understand portions either. I see images of healthy food in large portions, then I replicate that (using minimal oil- Yes, thats something i do control) and eat it. But still turn out fat at the end because I’ve probably consumed too much ‘healthy’ food. My portion size idea is so distorted and im trying to learn the calories of things and use nutrition references on packaged stuff. It’s hard tho.
It was very nice to watch how Jason talk about his fatherhood experience. I wish more man have the same understanding of importance about the time they spend with their children.
I&#39;m 60, I  started 3 years ago when I realized I had allowed myself to become very unhealthy and 350lbs.  I was always a tiny bit heavier than the other kids but it never stopped me from doing everything they did...<br><br>My parents were healthy eaters and did not allow fast food or junk food, I ate healthy, my portions were too large and I did eat fast food and junk away from the house, not a lot but enough to hurt me...  at 19 I lost 100lbs and stayed between 180 to 160 for years.  I never dieted, or took diet medication I just watched what I ate and I was active.<br><br>My husband was diagnosed with dementia in 2014 and I let myself go again...  <br><br>350lbs <br><br>So I went back to eating healthy with smaller portions, stayed away from junk food, I&#39;m lucky in the fact that I don&#39;t like fast food or going out to eat, I like to cook...<br><br>I&#39;m 207  and still loosing...   I removed almost all GMOs and gluten along with eating organic and 100 % grass fed meat...  I do believe that the horrible chemicals that are allowed into our food cause many problems to our health ...   <br><br>It&#39;s a lifestyle not a diet and there are many healthy foods that taste wonderful  .<br><br>If you want to loose weight you can, you really can, it&#39;s a mind set, but you can do it...
“Body positivity” in her eyes means body shaming skinny people 🎉
Kiana, thank you so much for having a channel dedicated to underrated issue of mental health. So many people don&#39;t know that food addiction, portion control, important for exercise, etc. is normal. I have been of average weight, since childhood, and health conscious parents, who know the importance and balance of food and other things. Having two time suffering from COVID, I know now how all of this is incredibly important. In my recovery from second time Covid, I started light exercises, yoga everyday and it literally changed me as a person. I never had food addiction and even have only 1 food delivery app, in modern day times, behaviour consciousness is important and being introduced to root basis of behaviour is important
NICE I CAN GO TRAVEL TO TORONTO AND CASUALLY ASK FOR AN APOLOGY FOR SKINNY SHAMING AND MAKING FUN OF AND EIGHT YEAR OLD WITH CANCER
I disagree with a lot of your opinions, but I watch you because i think it’s important to watch people you disagree with because it makes you question things, which is important. Since watching your videos it’s made me realize that I don’t need to feel bad for losing weight, it’s my body and I’m allowed to do what I want with it. Since then I’ve lost 20 pounds, and I’ve started doing Pilates every morning, which has actually helped alot with my mental illnesses. The weight loss has also helped alot with my confidence, i wish I could’ve been confident at my bigger size, but unfortunately I can change my opinions but I can’t change the world, and being able to shop at more stores has had an impact as well on my well-being . I really became indoctrinated by body positivity, and I think there definitely needs to be a more healthy medium. No one should feel bad for losing weight if it’s done in a healthy manner that makes you feel better
Nah, im on skinny camps 😂
Same. I was 260 at my heaviest. I will never be the skinny kid in my heart. Some of my<br>Coworkers think of me as the “skinny guy” despite the fact that I don’t have any veins, my waist is 31”, I have bad cardio, etc.<br>Hearing that they think I’m skinny doesn’t really help. In the moment it might make me feel better about myself, but in the long term it makes me only feel like a fraud… I don’t really handle compliments well because of the time that I was fat and all the fake compliments I got trying to get a rise out of me, no real affection for my entire teenage years through to adulthood.<br>Since losing the weight my confidence has gone up but not to a level where I feel confident. I just feel like I’m constantly on the verge of tears because I have no self-image anymore and I have no idea who to trust.
You should try the essence plumping nudes lipgloss!!
“Body positivity”<br>“I’m prettier and cooler”<br>Girl yo better shush. Your whole personality is being oversized.<br>Every. Single video.<br>“GRWM!!” Normal.. but just bcs she’s oversized she milks views. <br>“UNPACKING OVERSIZED CLOTHING” bruh

A moment of silence for the horse who attempted at the worlds heaviest weight lifting 😔
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADlFj-mDyb0&amp;t=1m47s">1:47</a> i agree !!! Its what is the most disgusting horrific child abuse running around right now!!!!!
Bruh<br>Body positive bestie?? <br>You skinny shame people your not spreading body positivity
For me it’s healing from my eating disorder, I was extremely restrictive for years so when covid hit I was already having issues with binging and knowing that no one would be seeing me I didn’t care how bad I got. I ended up gaining 80 pounds from my “weight restored” healthy weight. I’m down 40 and now it’s time to say goodbye to the next 40
i hate to tell you but uhm there’s a weight limit and your over it
Your so fat that you broke the staircase to heaven original: MDU
If you wanna be &quot;appreciated&quot; so bad then how about you apologise for skinny shaming people, making fun of a CHILD who had cancer and for even being on this platform 😘
Nikki Haley is absolutely a neocon and I agreed with Vivek that she&#39;s Dick Cheney is 5 inch heels as she so willingly pointed out!<br><br>Wish DeSantis had not run now, waited until 2028, and put his full support behind Trump and force the GOP to recognize Trump whether they like it or not!<br><br>Loved Vivek pointing out the lack of success and mediocrity of the RNC Chair too! She&#39;s Romneys niece for Pete&#39;s Sake, we know Romney is a RINO!
I&#39;ve seen like one episode of 1000lb sisters, so I don&#39;t know much about them. This video opened my eyes and really showed me how much I&#39;m like Tammy. Wow. This is mind blowing to me. And explains why I&#39;ve had very minimal success in my own weight loss journey. Thank you for making this video. Really, thank you!
This is the definition of disgusting
“Okay well first of all if we are going to talk about triggers, social media in and of itself is a GIANT trigger” <br><br>YES, agreed Demi! 🙌🏻
The milk was better than one size the milk one didn’t much like at all
The poorest ppl  in America are the fattest. No one is starving here!
People confuse the traits of a narcissist way too often with the traits of BPD or with plain old overcorrection of extremely low confidence.<br>She hates herself. When she says she’s great and all, all she’s doing is trying to convince herself. You can tell she doesn’t like herself at all. In fact, she dislikes herself so much that she’s already confident beforehand that she’ll fail at losing weight.
I&#39;ve recently tried skipping out on breakfast and lunch and just eating a big meal at the end of the day, semi keto, semi carnivore but I do allow for some sweets.  I gave tried calorie tracking before and meal prepping but having to have lunches packed and ready everyday takes a lot of effort, it&#39;s easier for me to buy some steak and eggs or salmon, freeze it. Let it thaw then come home after working and have a nice big meal. It&#39;s more convenient for me than planning out an entire weeks worth of meals and making sure I bring something to lunch because when I miss a day I still feel like I need to eat at work so I&#39;ll grab lunch, or get a snack and it&#39;ll cause me to fall off the wagon. <br>Yes, this message is scattered. Last year I started watching your videos and felt inspired to lose weight. I tracked calories diligently for about 4 months and lost about 40lbs.but the demands of my job caught up, I was working a lot of double and mg sleep was suffering, I didn&#39;t have time to prep meals I was stressed and decided to just give up and started eating out again. Id stopped going in mg afternoon walks, I stopped trying. I gained everything back and that makes it so much harder to want to try again because I know just how long it will take to get back to where I was i think the secret may be to not just stick to one approach. Calorie counting or intermittent fasting or a particular diet. But to be adaptive to change. Right now the 1 meal a day strategy seems to be working but I feel like I need to be flexible thanks for reading if indeed you did and I love your channel
Damn you are very desperate for a date. Well first you need to apologize for skinny shaming a 16 year old girl
idgaf what you&#39;re eating  EATING LESS MAKES YOU LOSE WEIGHT. These uneducated fucks dont understand basic calorie deficit
That deep manly laugh.  Gross. <br>Those Chompers. <br>Noooo.  Just no
Lose weight then 👍, problem solved
She takes morbid obesity to a whole new level. 😂
Currently my goal is to lose enough weight for my bathroom scale to be able to measure me.  I&#39;m getting there.  My doctor&#39;s office can scale me, so that&#39;s where I check myself out.  Let&#39;s gooooooooooooo
One pound equals 3500 calories. Most people shouldn&#39;t be eating that many calories a day to maintain their weight, so how do you lose a pound a day? It&#39;s impossible.
Gross human
“You should load bridges down with extra weight because it actually helps stabilize their joints” - a fact activist engineer, probably
To eat a salad predominate diet , you have to use an oil , grapeseed , olive , peanut etc., etc., and mixed with spices and or different vinegars . Using mayonnaise , sour cream , etc., etc., based dressings is redundant . As well pure olive oil as an example is a healthy choice because of its high polyunsaturated fat content, it is also resistant to oxidation at high temperatures, making it a good choice for baking as well as cooking.
&#39;Releasing fat!&quot; 🤣BTW isn&#39;t eating less than 300 Calories &#39;deadly&#39;? Please do not go for these bizarre diets guys, exercising/walking/swimming are the best ways to reduce weight along with a &#39;Normal&#39; junk-free diets.
This has opened up my eyes I really needed to hear this thx for the video and I have been experiencing with my own issues at stake because of how I keep struggling with how other people keep telling me to lose weight
I love how proud doctor Proctor looks when he approves her for weight loss surgery.
Once again, it is incomprehensible how do people live in the West. What do you eat thrice every day, donuts? <br>That &#39;Victorian diet&#39; is precisely what I eat as an individual with low finances in Moscow. Meat is mostly unaffordable for me, as well as prepackaged snacks or fast food which is not cheap if you compare it to meals you can cook at home from raw ingredients. You get whatever is seasonal cause seasonal is the cheapest. Like, it has been cauliflower a month ago, it&#39;s corn right now, oranges will be seasonal somewhere in winter while currently they are expensive, etc.<br>Never changed the size of my clothes after childhood.
I don&#39;t live in the UK anymore but we also have obese folks here now too. Growing up there was 1, yes ONE McDonald&#39;s restaurant in my town of fewer than 800 000 people. Now there are 10 McDonald&#39;s, 5 burger kings, 3 five guys, Edwards sandwich places, KFC Starbucks all over. What do most of these places have in common? Super size V super skinny was on when us style fast food was just starting to grow in the UK. They were not flexing they were trying to prevent the bad habits from forming. Warn people of the coming storm. Yes England invented capitalism but the us weaponised it. When you have socialised Medical care such as the NHS or SECU the govt uses media to cushion the blow of upcoming crisis. Because everything is free it puts more responsibility on the citizens to adjust their behaviour for the greater good. Super size as well as embarrassing bodies were part of an effort to make a generation who had never known rationing or war to be more conscious of the ways their behaviour affects other and the nation. Watching probably re-edited episodes years later without the long ass public service messages at the start and end is a very different experience. Not specifying these details as one complains about the finger pointing....come on...no no dear. This show exists in a social, economic and cultural context and you know it. I have my issues with Dr. discount Benedict Cumberbatch but he and those 2 other Dr ladies he worked with on ITV were trying to do good not only for the people but for the NHS in the sweet sweet summer pre Brexit days.
Fat jokes NEVER go too far. The feeling of &quot;shame&quot; exists for a reason. You feel that because you know you&#39;re not supposed to be that gross. Go to the gym .
At this point, it’s not even about being happy with your appearance. Like you’re just delusional. Do you not realise you’re going to die young because of your weight? You need to fight for your life. Also don’t body shame a 16 yr old maybe
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kKUTWZSg8&amp;t=4m20s">4:20</a> I agree with everything you say except for the &quot;personal choices&quot; rhetoric.  In an Ideal world yes our outcomes in life would be the complete result of our choices but in society as it is structured today (capitalism etc.) Most people are stuck within boundaries set by genetics and socioeconomic status hence the reason some of the poorest countries are the most obese. I 100% agree people should put all effort into self improvement but it is usually only the exceptional ones who will break free of their boundaries.  For the best results we need societal level changes.
They already took a founding father and race switched them. Its called &#39;Hamilton&#39;
Most women don&#39;t know much about this argument and it is sad. Women get fought for and protected. Men have to do the fighting and protecting. Yes some women can fight and also are good in the military. Exceptions do not make the rules. That would be an exception. Men have a duty to protect women and children, even if you do not know them. It is amazing to me how many women will scream equality for women and then as soon as you bring up the argument that labor intensive tasks and military services are mostly men, they want to say that that is not part of the argument. Men and women are NOT equal. NO ONE is perfect. Men do some things better than women and women do some things better than men. Stop crying about it and just understand that fundamentally men and women are different. Men have been oppressed. Women have been oppressed. Can we move on with our lives and just agree to be better as human beings and not as genders or races? We all bleed the same. Just get along with people. You don&#39;t have to like anyone. Just give basic human respect to everyone, regardless. And if we all did that, the world would be a much better place. But too many people think that they are the main character in the story of the world and cannot just be humble enough to be nice to others even though that is how they demand to be treated. I don&#39;t recognize this ugly world any more and I just wish people could have the decency to be kind to one another at the very least. It isn&#39;t hard.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTLe9kBfO4c&amp;t=9m53s">9:53</a> The HYPOCRISY of saying that these shows degrade people and teach children that those who suffer from obesity are freaks and outcasts, only to say later on that Ableism in “comedy” performances are ‘funny and acceptable’ is truly disgusting; imagine how people that have Special Needs feel when they are ostracized and deemed ‘unwanted’ in any form of media.
Y&#39;all don&#39;t defend her.. she has skinny shamed many ppl and made fun of her sister who has cancer, she deleted the video but she captioned it is &#39;WHO&#39;S HEALTHIER NOW?&#39;.. that&#39;s beyond mean
I have just binge watched heaps of your videos! I am learning so much and really loving the advice and science behind why we do what we do. I am very guilty of binge eating and have struggled with my weight/body image my whole life. I didn&#39;t even know it was considered a disorder! Thank you so much for making these videos. ❤️
A little bit about Jaimie: she has skinny shames so many people and in one of her deleted videos she said next to her EIGHT YEAR OLD sister who had cancer and captioned it “who is healthier now?” She is an awful person. Don’t try to defend her. She doesn’t deserve it. She has said so many awful things and acts like a Angel. Why would you say “ your so pretty “ when she honestly doesn’t deserve it. If she acted differently and was a good person then sure support her but she isn’t. She’s awful - Liv<br><br>PSA: THIS IS NOT MINE BUT LET&#39;S KEEP SPREADING IT!!!
So the girl can’t get to the fridge or make a meal herself. To gain the weight the siblings really are enabling this train wreck.
Good if they go along with this they will stop reproducing last thing the world needs is more beta simps breeding . The “ men “ in these situations have the power to shut this foolish down but choose not to.
One more reason, you survived eating a triple whopper instead of getting a heart attack while skinny shaming 16 year old girls.
Weight loss is really tough. I get discouraged that ill never get past this plateau after doing well. Amy is inspiring for me. Im just trying to keep 50lbs off and its near impossible!!
Jews are only successful because they study a lot ❤ people are just envious... Such an ugly trait... They should study more and try to be smarter ffs
Body positivity should also include more for people with IBS and PCOS ( beyond weight gain! ) we struggle with acne, bloating, and worse. We could be normalizing that but nah we’d rather normalize unhealthy eating I guess
And fat activists say this crap isn&#39;t unhealthy.
Always we have options and choices,  do not blame food companies, do not buy and don&#39;t eat, if we r fat it us over fault.
If simple carbohydrates are not very good for a diet, does anyone know if fats like butter, milk, cheese are okay in moderation? Or would it be best to avoid them as well?
Clean your damn air fryer, gross
My take is &quot;fat positivity&quot; is just an extremist group that has given up on improving themselves. It is dedication and work to be healthy, but they are so incredibly insecure that they have to convince others, that are also overweight, that living this unhealthy life is more beneficial so they don&#39;t have to actually have to try work at anything. If they put as much energy in trying to convince people to stay on this path of self-destruction, imagine what they could do if they actually tried to lose the weight.
Jesus. dude. You are showing you&#39;re ultimate thicko right here. Mouthing off at an angle that doesn&#39;t apply to the subjects you comment on. TRY HARDER.
olipop is gross 🤮
Butter in cereal sounds really gross
I have in my possession two books one called the commonsense cookery book reprinted in 1962, but it is older than that it has a lot of recipes about brain and other parts of the animal that we don&#39;t eat in many recipes and another book called The Colonial cook book most of the recipes are from news clippings and the book was first published in 1864. There is so much use of every part of the animal and so much fat, lard and other animal products that you cook with used. My grandmother also used to cook when my mum was young. Most of these foods oxtails, brains, lots of liver everything was cooked in some kind of fat. One thing when I was a child that she did do is the lard was always kept and reused until it was unusable. She never cooked any of these recipes when I was a kid maybe if I had known I would have asked her too. The family were in middle class and my Nana was a stay at home mother to four. There was also a historical study that found now I&#39;m probably going to quote it wrong but it was 100 or more soup recipes that women in the Middle ages had to learn in England before they got married. Each one had for different health benefits or ways to help their husbands. There is also a fishmonger in Melbourne who sells fish and then the shop right next door that he owns he uses every part of the fish to make food for people and it is getting quite popular.
She is smiling and plus she&#39;s going to her own death bed
Such an incredible interview! We can&#39;t get enough plus and midsize body inspiration.
“WOOOOW” time for you to apologize for skinny shaming a 16 year old
fat shaming and skinny shaming are bad and you my dear skinny shamed 🖕
Fat shaming and skinny shaming are the same. Restricted access to Health care is the result of someone neglecting their health like how smokers do. Don&#39;t be dumb
I&#39;ve been struggling this past week because I just got a sleeve gastrectomy last Wednesday. I&#39;m having trouble emotionally adjusting to the change and wishing I had the ability to eat to cope like I used to. I&#39;ve been watching Megan Anne&#39;s and your videos since one of Megan&#39;s randomly got suggested to me. I was scared of watching it at first, believing it was going to be making fun of obesity or making light of the struggle. You and Megan have handled this issue with such care and grace that it was easy to subscribe to both of you. I realized pretty quickly I had been in Megan&#39;s similar position with the fat acceptance movement creating a loop of self-sabotage disguised as self-care. A year ago, I was close to 600 pounds. As of yesterday, I&#39;m at the 480-something mark and I&#39;m just getting started. Megan said something in her 315-pound life video that really hit home with me. She said she would have to talk to her therapist about how she treated her body so badly for all those years. I realized I need to explore this topic too. I treated my body badly because emotionally, I didn&#39;t feel worth being treated any better. Now that I love who I am on the inside and am incredibly grateful to my body for not giving up on me, I&#39;m using yours and Megan&#39;s videos to reaffirm I&#39;m making the right choices (and the truly courageous ones) in facing my fears, addictions, and insecurities to have a better quality of life. I deserve it. If you&#39;re reading this, you deserve to be here. &lt;3
Sounds very reasonable to me! Fascinating! Some days I feel like a sustainable, healthy diet, free of questionable gmo&#39;s and hybrids is impossible.  We have removed ourselves so far from the source of our foods and even access to seeds for unaltered &quot;heirloom&quot; vegetables/fruits are hard to get. It&#39;s one of the downsides of capitalism: once an item becomes marketable, sellers are going to find a way to provide it for the least amount of effort and expense on their part and buyers, after becoming dependent on buying instead of making, will adapt to whatever downgrade provided.  Don&#39;t get me wrong - I am extremely grateful for the scientists and researchers who have worked to make food more abundant and available than ever, but it has been at a cost.  We have occasionally had a garden, and I&#39;ve always just assumed my weight loss during harvest was due to the extra physical exertion, but now I realize that a lot of it probably had to do with the fact that my house was so full of fresh veg, I didn&#39;t have room for junk food lol.
When I worked in construction I skipped breakfast and ate protein bread for lunch at around 12pm. Usually chicken or pasta dinners at 18pm. On Fridays I went to Burger King 😅 That was my best weight ever. Skipping breakfast is totally feasible, and remember that it&#39;s always ok to not eat if you&#39;re not hungry.
I love that these insane diets always include cutting out processed food. In my diet, all you need to do is spin around every time someone mentions the weather, pray to Sheogorath every hour, and cut out processed food. You’ll lose weight!
The only thing that&#39;s worked for me is doing keto. I don&#39;t have the desire to binge eat at all. My portion sizes, even when I have free reign on a &quot;cheat meal,&quot; are significantly smaller than what they once were. I don&#39;t have any cravings for the junk food that people binge on - chips, candy, chocolate, donuts, pizza, etc. - and no one really wants to binge on low carb foods like eggs. Junk food creates a chemical high in your brain.
The second fast food kid is fat because both her parents are fat.
One of her best videos. Plus I learned a lot. Thank you Tati for your honesty.
Only due to motivation I did my weight loss. No skill, totally aggressive environment for my weight loss. Just stubborness from my side and wanting to change. Everything else aligned later on.<br>Leptin and insult resistance is not spoken much about. Thats a great issue. They being put on appetite suppressants by endocrinologist.
Fat camp?? Looks like it didn&#39;t  work for you 😂😂😂
You would break the surfboard <br><br>FYI: don’t skinny shame people ok thanks love😒
There is a saying in nursing homes, &quot;There are old people and there are fat people but there are no old fat people.&quot;
You gave the one size and 11/10... even tho it literally smeared worse than the product before. You might not do sponsors, but you&#39;re definitely biased
So I was doing strength camps around that time. I weighed in just under 180lbs at 5&#39;11&quot;, had a 33&quot; waist, and A&amp;F clothes did not fit me right. My shoulders were too broad, and both my quads and calves were literally too big to get their pants on. It was absurd. Basically if you were a guy and were not legit skinny with muscles or just skinny, their clothes were not going to fit you. And by &quot;Skinny&quot; I don&#39;t mean 13%-15% BF, I mean sub 10% body fat if you had any type of athletic build. I&#39;d occasionally see regularly built guys with decent size muscles with button downs and T-shirts that were skin tight. I wondered why I never saw any of them with the shirts buttoned. When I tried some on I found out. It&#39;s because they could not button them.<br><br>As for the girls section, yeah, again, you needed to be crazy thin to fit into their clothes, and regular size hips on a size 5 was probably going to put you in a size 10 as the clothes ran so small across the board it was ludicrous. I liked the style of the clothes quite a bit, but the tailors who designed them definitely made their audience far smaller than it should have been. I mean c&#39;mon, I wore 32&quot; waist jeans/cargos in half of the brands I wore at the time, 33&quot; in the others, and I could not fit into their pants or shorts correctly? Stupid. Heh, I was a big <i>&quot;Dawson&#39;s Creek&quot;</i> fan though. That final episode. Oh those folks at the CW got me. Tearing up when I saw Jen talking to Grams, then the ending with Joey, Pacey and Dawson... <i>sniffle</i> Great, here I go again...
No I look fat
Man shes got a big gut thick all over
This was just. Disgusting.
This is why when i want to lose weight, i eat the healthy stuff first. I don&#39;t forbid other stuff, i just eat the healthy meal first, which does signal my brain that it&#39;s full, so if i do have a bit of something junky, it&#39;s only a bit and it&#39;s not compulsive. I don&#39;t feel restricted this way. But it does take a few days for the good food to start signaling to your brain that you&#39;re full. In the first days, i feel way hungrier and it takes me a bit to feel full earlier
yeah but throw back to the time you skinny shame ppl and get angry when ppl fat shame when really they’re just reminding you of what you did 😀❤️
I find it interesting that on this video, where she&#39;s not loving herself, people are saying &quot;you need better self esteem, be kind to yourself&quot; but on her videos where she had a good vibe and outlook, people are saying &quot;this is disgusting, don&#39;t glorify obesity, how dare you NOT hate yourself&quot;.........<br><br>Since making this comment i have learned shes a liar and a swindler and will make up just about any outrageous story for sympathy to get gifts. Shoes and handbags dont &quot;help&quot; with ones ED. She creates false drama to have something to complain about,  she just sucks. That being said straight up cyberbullying isnt ok. (But weirdly is what her entire platform is about) If you dont like her, the most powerful thing you can do is not enagage, and hit &quot;do not recommend.&quot; Dont give her views, dont give her comments.
Funny... I just prepared soup (from scratch, not industrial crap). My daughter enjoyed it. Since I became better preparing food properly, my kids eat more of that and less junk food. They actually prefer &quot;mommys homemade food&quot;😉. Both me and my husband make proper dinner every school day. In the weekends (not the whole weekend though) we all treat ourselves with some take-out and snacks. Or sometimes a luxury home made dinner. We never struggled with weight issues, though, but it doesn&#39;t matter. REAL food is crucial for all kids growing up, weight issues or not. Cooking is not as hard as people think. Of course it&#39;s ok to eat junk food even now and then, but not every day or several times a week. Besides, there are stuff in industrial made food in N America that is banned here in Europe. I wonder what they put in there .. 😬
Hey Kiana! I just discovered your channel, and the amount of research and effort you put into your videos is amazing. I’ve found them very informative, and interesting to hear the science and psychology behind a lot of this.<br><br>Have you ever looked into the affect that infrastructure has on our weight as a culture? I would love to hear your insight on that kind of topic as well. <br><br>Getting into Not Just Bikes (another big YouTuber) recently has been so eye opening to me how much the sheer structure of our society as a whole traps people. We aren’t forced to move in our daily lives anymore, and in fact we are discouraged from being active in a more natural way, and I find the psychology behind that kind of thing fascinating as well, as it really ties into the obesity epidemic all over the world. Being active for the sake of health alone has never been natural to humanity, we always had to be active in order to live, and now that has changed so much.<br><br>Anyways thanks for all your hard work, keep fighting the good fight! :)
The COVID pandemic should be all the proof you need. An overwhelming majority of COVID related deaths were.. Obese people, or at the minimum overweight. And people will try to spin it like &quot;oh well they already had underlying conditions that COVID just amplified..&quot; yes, underlying conditions caused by being obese in the first place. It&#39;s a disease that the body constantly tries to fight and thus we have type II diabetes and high blood pressure and all sorts of other things.
Fat camp? That a thing??? 🤢
these products  leave you looking fresh and youthful, plumped skin texture, dewy finish. Yes i do think its an &#39;lunch after swimming/sunbathing, look.&#39; ...Or a &#39;cool, fresh , pink  &#39;walking through Green Park [london] &#39; feel/look. ...her sheer blush, becomes a bit more understandable, innocent, cool, natural, healthy. , no makeup look...
STOP SCROLLING THOS IS IMPORTANT MESSAGE! At this point,we know that Jamie reads the comments, because these videos just CANT be serious. So instead of filling her comments with fat jokes she’s trolling us. JAMIE if you are reading this, we demand an apology (with tears) for you skinny shaming a 16 year old girl, blaming your older sister for you being fat, and other things which you know there are REPOST THIS ON JANIES VIDEOS TO GET THE WORD OUT WE NEED AN APOLOGY 😢😡
Omg he’s so hideous though lol
Ok I know she skinny shames people but when you call her fat and stuff like that your shaming other people to so just stop
Bro is people being mean to her bcs she is JUsT fat leave the girl alone lol
I almost lost hope on losing weight and yet I found your video. Thank you.
A lot of these fat acceptance people take half of a fact they kinda heard and run with it. Like being super lean 24/7 is unsustainable for most people because to do that you either have to be on tren or in a calorie deficit, both of which will cause health problems if continued for a long period of time. It is healthy to have some fat on you, however the healthy range is 18-30% depending on gender and genetics (some peoples bodies just work different. Though between 25 and 30% can still be healthy so long as ur eating healthy, drinking enough water and exercising enough. Clean bulks aren’t gonna cause any significant health problems). There is a point when it’s too much. Or how a lot of them say that 90% of the time dieting doesn’t work (I’ve heard eating healthy at all doesn’t work too, and that person is gonna die), which is true in reference to fad diets and changing your entire diet cold turkey. Making slow and gradual changes, finding healthy recipes you enjoy, not being super restrictive and meal prepping at least one meal every week is the key to long term success. The reason why fad diets don’t work is because the people who do them don’t understand nutrition and will just go back to eating how they used to after they’ve lost all the weight. The reason why cold turkey doesn’t work is because it leads to burnout. It’s the same reason being super restrictive doesn’t work, and on the people it does, it also borders on disordered eating and often there’s a correlation with an unhealthy relationship with food (Im not talking about athletes or something temporarily being super restrictive before like a weigh in or a show or something, Im talking about the instagram “nutritionists” who are like “you can’t eat bread, seed oil, meat, vegetables, water, milk ect.” They’re also the same ones who drink bleach because they believe it gives them health benefits. Basically the jilly juice mfs).
Milk did better than one size on till dawn
When is the video &quot;dressing up to apologize to the 16 yo girl I skinny shamed&quot; gonna come out?
Fat parents tend to raise fat kids. The parents fail because they&#39;re full of sad excuses. They blame the air for being too cold to go for a walk, blame not having enough time, and blame others for something. Fat people never take on their own responsibility. It&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault they&#39;re fat.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnZS3EbMHc&amp;t=4m19s">4:19</a> is being skinny and beautiful everything you hoped it would be? Serious question, though I assume you garner more self worth from the positive changes you&#39;ve managed to make, more than from staring into the mirror.<br><br>You&#39;re a big (small) inspiration to a lot of us.
The parents of that 13 year old are infuriating, they&#39;re clearly causing the problem, they also fat as well, but they blame everything on the child.
He announces that he weighs 300 lb and the woman&#39;s reaction is &#39;Baby, congratulations&#39;?!!! He&#39;s gained more weight than I weigh, and I am 5 ft 7 (and used to be 5 ft 8 - collapsed discs due to physically demanding jobs).
Guys if you don’t understand why people are sending hate comments is bc that Jaimie did some bad things that are so wrong so basically she skinny shamed a 16 yrs old that didn’t do anything and she mocked her sister l think but her sister had cancer and she said “ who’s healthier now” l think but yea l hope that made sense!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Edit: apologized Jaimie<br><br><br><br><br><br>Edit2: if you can’t found the videos then she probably deleted them so she doesn’t get any hate so l don’t have poof but lk this bc l saw this
When you are lifting weights concentrate on pushing your bellybutton to your spine. Concentrate on your core. This will help with your neck issue.
Babe we’re not your besties <br><br><br>Besties do not skinny shame people<br><br><br><br>           APOLOGIZE!!!!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=4m45s">4:45</a> in all fairness that statistic isn&#39;t really a comparison. one thing to credit the USA on there is the honesty of the statistic, when they say you&#39;re obese you are ACTUALLY obese. UK it not the same, most people branded &quot;Obese&quot; are above average weight at best. <br><br>I&#39;m a 5&#39;10, male - weighing at 15.4 stone(215.6 pounds?) and I&#39;m considered obese... When reality is im actually quite average in size. I fit most medium size clothing which at ideal weight(in with the UK claims is 12 stone- 168pound- at max) will still be my clothing fit.
For me the eyeopening moment that made me realize I needed to eat healthier and loose weight was in 2020 after a 6month furlough due to pandemic. <br><br>I have always been lucky that I was a skinny teen despite eating whatever I wanted. People thought I was undereating until they actually saw me eat 😅 So between 16 and 25 I ate whatever I wanted without gaining an ounce, I stayed the same weight throughout give or take 1kg. And not really developing healthy eating habits 😅<br><br>When I came back to work from my furlough last year, my work uniform was too small and I had to ask my boss for a bigger size (embarassing). This prompted me to ask myself «did I really gain so much weight lately?» 🤔 And for the first time in 10 years, I stepped on the scale. Bit of a shock to see I had actually gained over 20kg in the last 10 years. I suddenly very clearly saw myself turning into my mom. <br><br>My mom is the most wonderful kind and generous person in the world and I love her so much, but she is quite overweight. I see her struggle, now in her 60’s, when we go shopping. She needs breather breaks and small distances for her seem many miles, painful on her joints and too exhausting. I can see the health problems her weight is causing and I realized I do not want to turn into my mom. I want to be able to walk without pain or exhaustion when I am in my 60’s. I want to travel without fitting too tight in seats on transportation. I want to be more fit and healthy than my mom is now when I reach that age. <br><br>I realized my streak of eating whatever I wanted was over and that I needed to eat less, more healthy and start exercising. If I didn’t, I would just gain another 20kg the next 10 years and then I would really notice health problems. <br><br>So for me, loosing weight now means staying fit and active and capable of doing whatever I want in the future and in my old age. I want to be an active world travelling granny! ☺️ Not sure if that vision is clear enough but for me, not becoming my mom, is a great motivator 🤷‍♀️ I lost 5kg in the past 6months so I am taking it slow and steady so I can keep this new healthier eating patern for many years to come.
Ok ok ok ok listen I think you should not wear the sauna suit ever again that was hideous…💀💀💀
DISCLAIMER!!! This is not how you lose fat,  this is how to get the biggest differenceon the scale, if you are a woman and you try this you may go sterile DONT DO THIS SHIT!!!. How to drop 20lbs+ in 5 days: day 0 start of being 240lbs+ eat a disturbing about of salt and carbs, drink a ton of water. Day 1 do the same and have a GIGANTIC meal before you step on the scale. Day 2-4 cut all carbs and reduce salt to a low level. Day 5: don&#39;t drink water between you wake up and you step on the scale.
Y&#39;all wanna talk about how those makeup legit made no differences? I mean she&#39;s still the same fattie😭
skinny world..pff, I think most skinny girls are crammed up in the VS  show..but the rest of us...I don.t know anyone who looks like that. love you girls, you&#39;re so definitely not  alone
As an American, and therefore part of a country that is notorious for overeating junk food, you really have a nerve pointing out English mistakes.
I found that exercise doesn&#39;t help me lower my appetite at all. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite. I started going to the gym regularly about two months ago, I eat more that I did, healthier than I did, and god am I hungry all the time! Now I just consider it a way to allow myself more calories while not gaining weight
Lose weight then 👍, problem solved
I actually prefer the realness of this show, who actually would want the fake smiles and all this said behind your fatty back then in your face?
I’m not pre-diabetic or diabetic yet, but I’m definitely heading down that road due to food addiction. Type 2 diabetes runs in my family, and insulin resistance does as well. Thank you for informing me about eating more protein and fiber! I’m hoping to slowly lose some weight and overall live a healthier lifestyle.
Diet is gross.
You should do a video on the British show fat families! It’s along the lines of secret eaters and supersize vs super skinny
Jeffery , thank you so much for your tutorials. I&#39;ve been watching you apply your makeup, and you have taught me so much! I finally have contacts, and I don&#39;t have to hide behind reading glasses.  I&#39;ve felt like an ugly duckling with my glasses. I wasn&#39;t able to put makeup on because I couldn&#39;t see without makeup.  But now you have inspired me to go and buy contacts so I can see to put on my makeup! Thank you so much for bringing me back to life, and I feel beautiful again. I love you, Jeffery Star ❤️❤️
Fat shaming and skinny shaming are the same. Restricted access to Health care is the result of someone neglecting their health like how smokers do. Don&#39;t be dumb
faty FAT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Things that might persuade me to vote for a Republican…<br><br>1, recognize that your most ardent supporters are a dying breed.<br>Two, embrace the changing demographics of this country.<br>Three, it’s fine to have your own personal religious beliefs and moral convictions (I’m a Christian myself) and of course you have every right and are strongly encouraged to live by them, but stop trying to turn your personal religious beliefs/moral convictions into law.<br>Four, listen to all your constituents’ concerns and work for all of them as you were hired to do, not just the ones who agree with you.<br>Five, loudly, publicly, forcefully, unapologetically and continuously condemn those within your party (no matter what percentage they may be) who give all of you a bad name; that applies to liberals/Democrats as well. you don’t want to be lumped in with racists, antisemitic people, white supremacists, confederacy lovers and/or bigots of any kind? Stop letting them speak for/represent you; show everyone, especially minority groups that in no way, shape or form will you stand for any of that.<br>Six, for all the talk about cracking down on illegal immigration and what not, start holding business owners who exploit those who enter this country illegally and pay them under the table accountable for their part in it. also, why not create a pathway to citizenship for those who while yes, enter this country illegally, work hard to support themselves and their families? Also the ones who were brought here illegally as infants/toddlers should be granted citizenship instead of one day being deported back to places they can’t even remember living in.<br>Seven, embrace the teaching of the good, the bad and the absolute downright ugly of this country‘s history and ways in which, yes, said history has had lasting effects on the present no matter how big or small. It does no one any good to deny history and it’s continuing ramifications, and only when we are finally honest with ourselves and each other can we truly work towards a better America; it will be an ongoing, never ending quest, but it can be done.<br>Eight, get behind some sort of healthcare reform. I don’t know if universal healthcare, Medicare for all or anything like that is a solution to the problem, but people shouldn’t have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for doctors appointments, hospital visits, major or minor procedures, medications prescribed to them etc. people shouldn’t have to forgo food, rent/mortgage payments, utilities etc. and risk eviction, foreclosure on their homes and/or disconnection of utilities to pay for those things. again I’m not sure what the solution is, but surely the richest country on the face of the planet can do better than what we’ve done.<br>Nine, of course people who are perfectly capable of working shouldn’t be allowed to abuse any form of government assistance; Social Security/disability, welfare, food stamps and stuff like that. However, those who are honestly trying, are underemployed even though they’re perfectly capable or who literally can’t work/help themselves shouldn’t have to pay the price. Ending those benefits/programs won’t help anyone.<br><br>There are other things on the list, but that’s all I’ve been able to think of for now.
Y’all if you didn’t know what she did she skinny shamed people and said to a cancer patient “who’s healthier now?”
ok why are all these so much hate? i heard she skinnyshamed, but you guys cant be talking, because your fatshaming her, which makes u think its even, but she said it 1 person on her chan skinnyshamed, which is her, but 566 people are fatshaming her, so its uneven you guys are making this earth die… and i undertsand why she skinnyshamed once, because she had to watch everyone get to fit in while she was sitting low.. :(
TRY BEING MY SIZE AMY! YOU DONT. KNOW. HOW. IT IS!
I love her having professional female athletes on. Many have spoken about how they might be a size 4-6, but designers still wont touch them because of how muscular they are. It drives me insane that you have to be stick thin with no fat/muscle for designers to work with women
fat people want the positive feedback skinny and attractive people get but dont want to put in the work to get skinny and more attractive
Hm I don&#39;t agree with many points here. Because a &quot;controlled&quot; Binge eating IS having control. The most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when the blood sugar drops so much that it&#39;s a body&#39;s mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things. But the thing you said with school is a whole different topic. For a diet it&#39;s bad, but for keeping your weight it&#39;s good.<br><br>I did this most of my school time while having hashimoto (which means my metabolismn is so bad that I get weight fast and lose weight hard) but I had my rule , first of all I never in my life eating breakfast if I have to wake up early, I had rule that if I have 6 hours school I eat and drink nothing during that time, if I have longer like 8 or 9 hours I will eat one apple. And this I continued like 7 years (?) and - it was fine. In the evening I ate tons of trash , huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly. Because it was like remaining in control during the day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy, and in evening you reward yourself for it. And I never gained any kg of weight during all the years. Of course I didn&#39;t lose neither, but also not gained weight. <br><br>So I disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar.
I have tattoos for people I love. One for my late grandfather, one for my late grandmother, one for my dog who passed away. Oh and one that I actually do regret getting a little 😂 but I plan on covering it up or removing it eventually. And I will be getting two more small tattoos, one for each of my sons.
The &quot;health at every size&quot; movement is particularly insidious because it contains a lot of grains of truth. Yes, you can be obese and still live an active lifestyle. Yes, BMI has its limitations as a diagnostic tool. And yes, it&#39;s wrong to bully people for their weight. HOWEVER, obesity is still a dangerous condition in its own right.
Gurl you say your fat. But when someone online says your fat you have a whole mental breakdown and make a completely unnecessary talking about how your getting shamed. Couldn’t get more stupid than that
I lost 93 lbs since 2019. My biggest wake up call was my husband and I went on a vacation in CA. We did a lot of walking and it was so hard for me. The second was we wanted to go snorkeling and needed a wet suit. None of them fit and I looked at myself in mirror and didn&#39;t like what saw. The 3rd was getting my blood results and everything was high. So I took a honest look at my lifestyle and started working on some of my bad habits. Than those got better and looked at other bad habits I needed to break. I learned as I went. If my weight loss slowed or stopped I adjusted my diet. It&#39;s been slow but effective. One thing that a lot of people do and I did as well in the past was give up if I fell off my diet or hit a bump in the road. Don&#39;t do that push through.
Ben, I understand that you’re upset about what happened to your homeland and rightfully so, but you’ve shown your true colors during these difficult times, and I gotta say that it’s truly ugly bro and I don’t support it and I’m done supporting a neocon war monger such as yourself.
It’s a shame Kim got to talk to Ashley about weight. Kim was the one who obsessed about losing weight to fit into Marilyn Monroe’s dress. She then spoke about how she dieted just to try be Marilyn for that event, and then said she binge ate pizza.  She is a bit fake when it comes to her ‘body positivity’, but I love Ashley because she is genuinely proud of her body and doesn’t waver from it. Kim just does whatever will get her attention.
There is answer to “ do you believe in God” is “ yes I do, and God does not create humans to be born fat, God gives us the freedom of choice and you choose to eat that which is unhealthy for you, causing you to become so fat that you may DIEEE.
Here&#39;s an unfortunate fact: 1 lb fat in the body can be processed into 3500 calories. So if you were to lose 69 lb fat in 2 weeks, you need to eat nothing and burn over 17000 calories per day. Even Michael Phelps or tour de france racers don&#39;t burn that much
Nah dude get her outa here for skinny shaming ppl💀 she thought she was she fr but she is looks like she could have a roll in the movie smile ong 😭💀
fat fuck: being fat is hard :( i can&#39;t move, i have diabetes, i can&#39;t walk T_T its so haaaaaard....*cries*<br>also the fat fuck: THE 60 BOXES OF PIZZAS IS NOT ENOUGH I NEED MORE FOOD!
Vivek Ramaswamy is clearly the most American candidate running. He wants to get back to our founding documents and the principles of individual responsibility and freedom.
This video has really driven home just how selfish and manipulative self-created victims truly are. Tammy is basically my ex-mother - she was so vile that I disowned her decades ago. But while I lived with her, I saw many of the traits Tammy displays. With my ex-mother, I called it her martyr role - she was constantly complaining, whining, and inviting people to join her pity party. She literally LIVED the victim mentality.<br><br>Yet, whenever anyone offered to help, she would say in a very martyred voice - &quot;oh no, don&#39;t you worry about me, I will do it myself&quot;- and then, in the next breath, complain AGAIN about how no one ever helps her. It was manipulative to a disgusting degree, interspersed with her hate-filled rants against people. Her racism was also offensive.<br><br>After I disowned her - she and ex-father had done things that should have landed them in jail - whenever people asked about my family, I would say that I no longer had contact, and sometimes I explained why. There were people who judged me for disowning those toxic people. I responded by kicking them out of my life - I wasn&#39;t going to tolerate anyone who expected me to go back to abusive people simply because &quot;but they&#39;re faaamily&quot;. <br><br>My siblings still kept in touch with their parents - and not only tolerated but enabled their toxic behaviours. And that cost one married brother his marriage - his wife and kids got fed up with the way he allowed his parents to treat them. I knew from that alone that I had made the right choice in kicking out two vile people out of my life.<br><br>Watching these videos about the infamous Tammy has reminded me of the extreme guilt tripping, pathological lies, gas lighting, rewriting reality, and shameless manipulation I endured from my ex-mother. She was innately dishonest with herself and with others, plays the victim card like a champion, and still uses my spineless brother as her lackey because she refuses to change her ways. And he is a full-fledged enabler and doormat.<br><br>I am grateful that I found the right sort of counsellor decades ago, who helped me recognise just how toxic these family members were and are. And these days, I don&#39;t feel a shred of guilt or shame about having kicked those people out of my life. It&#39;s about caring enough about my wellbeing to remove everyone and everything toxic out of my life, so they can no longer damage me. I now enjoy freedom and peace.
Jamie’s a horrible person her sister has cancer and she did a video it’s now deleted but you can still find it on YouTube she said who’s healthier now? To her sister that litterally has CANCER and she skinny shamed a 16 year old girl
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=0m02s">0:02</a> all the skinny people bar the blonde woman fourth from left are all normal skinny. Not super skinny.
Tammy desperately needs tough love. I can honestly say I’m thankful for the toughest moments of my life. Being left with pennies to my name &amp; a handful of clothes made me realize I need to make something of myself and be a strong, self reliant man. Being a functioning junky that was put into a hospital for a month made me realize what a useless lowlife I was and I needed to take full control &amp; responsibility of my life and actions. Tammy needs her false reality shattered, that is more loving than perpetuating her delusions which will make things worse and worse. The loving thing here is to confront her, not accommodate her sickness. If her family loved her, they’d set a better example &amp; someone take responsibility. It is no secret why she is so obese and acts this way, her parents have taught her everything they know.
If you want a snack eat fruit. Watermelon, strawberries, blueberries, grapes etc. You CAN NOT overeat on fruit. It is basically impossible due to how much water and fiber are in fruit. And certain ones have great nutrient content. Just make sure to vary which ones.
The persimmon is the edible fruit of a number of species of trees in the genus Diospyros. The most widely cultivated of these is the kaki persimmon, Diospyros kaki[1]  – Diospyros is in the family Ebenaceae, and a number of non-persimmon species of the genus are grown for ebony timber. In 2019, China produced 75% of the world total of persimmons. its flavor as “honey-like.” Its texture is similar to that of an apricot and its skin is a bit tougher than an apple&#39;s.
Ok so he is not the best person in the world but. I was 11 years old when I first saw this and instantly I accept him and his vibe. I didn’t know any better. And I fell in love with him at first sight. It’s a shame really. Cuz I could never tell ppl how much I still love him deep down bc everyone’s so fast to hate him. And I don’t blame them. He has done and said some disgusting things. But damn…no one’s perfect .
i  strive to be able to articulate my thoughts like you. Once again, another very well done video. I don’t struggle with my weight, but that factor didn’t stop me from wanting to hear more and more. How you were able to make this extreme case relatable to the general public is really impressive. Where ever you go next in your career, i really hope you find time to continue making videos bc we alllll love them
I only have 3 feet &amp; 9 in of small intestine (which is called Short Gutt Syndrome &amp; requires mass protein to maintain my weight). But there&#39;s a problem...<br>My left kidney was not attached to my body, just laying dormant in my butt cheek till I was 20. So now my right kidney has gone into failure and protein is as bad for the kidneys as caffeine &amp; salt is.<br>So I had to decide should I stay on the high protein &amp; go on dialysis next year or should I slowly starve to death?<br>My weight hovers between 98 and 101 lbs and I don&#39;t have alot of energy. I DO Eat alot of peanut butter (2 Tsp a day) cause hey, I gotta have SOME protein.<br>But I exist mostly on fruits &amp; grains. And I can honestly say, after not eating meat for awhile, if I put meat in my mouth, it literally makes me gag.<br>Sorry for the tangent I was just trying to stress how hard it can be when ya have specific dietary needs
I love your videos. I had NO idea you lost so much weight. You’re stunning!
OMG !! What a disgusting 🤢 🤮freak
As a skinny person who’s been called “anorexic,twig,skin and bones,branch etc body shaming skinny people rlly does hurt just as much
I think for personal experience that for  weight lost the best thing is getting medical help. I have lost 60 kilos (9.42 stones or 132 pounds) with mood stabilisers, similar thing for my wife, she lost huge amount of weight with medicines for the toroid.<br>Everything legally prescribed.
What I hate about kids&#39; makeup is that they think they should and can get away with making it cheap and gross. It&#39;s one thing if you want to think for the parents on making it easy to come off. It&#39;s another when you make it cheap and throw a high ass price on it and call it a day.
I liked Fat Families because it made light of the weight loss journey.  I feel there is too much sad emotions around weight loss and while its a serious issue, the seriousness itself can make weight loss seem like its a more difficult task than it needs to be.  The bluntness helps to de-personalize the fatness for me and allowed me to poke fun at myself instead of feeling crushing shame.   This strategy may not work for everyone, but it really did help me make weightless seem more achievable.   That and I&#39;d rather work off my wobbly-bum than my fat a$$.  Lol. EDIT: forgot to add, this was the first show that treats the entire family as a group instead of just trying to coach one person who is surrounded by enablers.
How about all those fat old people… Oh yeah, there aren’t any.
just because your older sister ruined your life, doesnt mean you have to skinny shame people 24/7, saying the n word,etc.
Girl you were so pretty you don’t need to be skinny. Everyone is pretty in their own ways and you’re the most prettiest person I’ve ever seen in my whole entire life. It doesn’t matter shapes or sizes. Everyone was built different and I want you to know that you are the most beautiful is person in the world if people don’t believe that then they’re insecure about yourself.
Say there is superskinny, skinny, normal, chubby, big.<br>Amy is normal-chubby. In the real world not every girl is deadly skinny. Plus, if your height is 180cm you cannot fucking wear a size 2 and look alive.
Father did a bear service for his kids. They would love the gesture now, but not later in life
If I were her sister, I&#39;d lock her in a room and give her a strict as all hell diet until she loses weight. Once she&#39;s able to walk on her own, I&#39;d leave. That&#39;s it. She&#39;s an adult. She can take care of herself after that. I would literally be so done with her so quickly
21 pounds in 21 days is possible, with a low enough intake over that time. Half of that weight is water and glycogen, and will go straight back on after the 21 days, but you can get the reading on the scale that low. For a man, fasted weight loss is around 0.6 lbs/day, so 12.6 lbs, and can lose around 8 pounds of water if you go from fully fed to this kind of restriction as you use up your glycogen stores and your cells dump sodium, both of which cause you to shed water, plus a pound for the glycogen itself. It’s not a good plan, and the “science” is bunk, but that claim itself is plausible if very misleading with a starvation diet.
Thank you for this misinformations videos. Meat is probably what keeps them alive despite not being the best available. Fruits are full of fructose which contribute to fatty liver, they are as healthy as candy. But hey, don&#39;t let science in the way of your misinformations.
Mam plz suggest me my age 30 ,my hite 5ft 7inch iam slim body weight 58kg I am intresting gym but any problem me .plz kindly advice.
I’m sorry that’s disgusting!
What is that? Cant tell if its fat or tumor growing
She&#39;s a horrible person I hate her sm she has shamed sm ppl in many different ways not only cancer shaming and skinny shaming she also said the n word
The doc:you need to lose weight her:ok/5mounths later the doc:bruh it looks like you have 40 baby in there bro I give up
1982 israel invaded south of lebanon and the Assad regime invaded north of lebanon and on top there was lebanese resistance and that is how PLO uder ARAFAT was defeated in lebannon.people have no idea what we suffered  in lebanon .they are 500 000 palestinians still living in lebanon and they have weapons still but they are under control. they tried during the years a lot of times to revolt ad fight the lebanese army for land control,,and i am sure 100 percent if they have the power again ,they will not hesitate to ocuupy lebanon .that is why no one wants them cause they are ungreatfull full of hatrate .(the majority)so please stop the double standard .
&quot;all I had was four pieces of pizza for breakfast, four pieces of pizza for lunch, and two cheeseburgers and some fries for dinner! Also i dunked all my pizza in a tablespoon of Caesar dressing with every bite, ate my fries covered in mayo and gravy and cheese, and washed every meal down with a liter of soda! I&#39;m still hungry! Why am I fat?&quot;<br><br>Yeah that&#39;s not a lot of food, but just by eating vegetables and meat (steak or chicken) and only drinking water or black coffee you could eat thrice as much and still be taking in the same amount of calories.<br><br>There&#39;s no excuse and there&#39;s no getting around it. If you consume more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. If you burn more calories than you consume, you will lose weight. Want gain weight eat more, want lose weight eat less, simple as 🤷‍♂️
I just can’t imagine living life in this condition. I have certainly had my own issues with weight but never obesity. As I’ve gotten older I have learned and accepted the fact that I have to eat a certain way and exercise a certain amount to keep myself at a healthy weight. While I enjoy the benefits of liking what I see in the mirror, the reason I do it is to enjoy the latter years of my life and have a nice retirement. It amazes me that these folks are still alive. But I find these shows to be extremely exploitive, amazing how low we’ve come to society to objectify these people who are obviously struggling with not only physical health but mental health issues
Not eating is kinda automatic weight loss lol. It even saves you money!

god, i used to be so miserable when i worked in hospitality. it was my WORST nightmare. i worked as a barista in a small family owned specialty coffee chain and they lived by &#39;the customer is always right&#39;. their big thing was to NEVER ask customers to leave, even after closing. in the summer, we had beautiful tables on a tall building&#39;s terrace overlooking the city and it was so nice at night. our business hours were 8AM-10PM but the strict company policy was to never ever kick guests out. they&#39;d let them sit outside until 11-12PM before very gently telling them we closed two hours ago, we would not get paid overtime, and on top of that, there was 30 more minutes of work to be done AFTER the last customers leave for closing. the place was located in an extremely boujee neighborhood and the people were very affluent and so incredibly entitled and abused the company policy to the fullest, only to leave a $1 tip for three people who stayed well into the night to accommodate them... it was the worst two years of my life working there. i was so unhappy. i hated our regulars from the bottom of my heart. DIRTY rich, zero manners, never tipped, talking about how they&#39;re cleaning their ex wives in divorces and sleeping with teenaged girls... there was one regular who had six sons by like 5 different wives, he would come in with them and his little ipad, order a single americano (no tip) and leave his six kids to terrorize the staff who had to keep them entertained (the youngest was maybe 18 months) and everyone had to suck it up because he was friends with the owners. when he was bored of his stupid offspring, he&#39;d bring them to us to babysit for free. never ordered a single drink/juice/food for the kids. i would literally walk up to a table without saying hello or smiling and just asking what can i get you. no hello, no goodbye, that job sucked the life out of me. i quit two years ago and i genuinely feel like i&#39;m still carrying that fatigue and stress in my bones.
Sounds very reasonable to me! Fascinating! Some days I feel like a sustainable, healthy diet, free of questionable gmo&#39;s and hybrids is impossible.  We have removed ourselves so far from the source of our foods and even access to seeds for unaltered &quot;heirloom&quot; vegetables/fruits are hard to get. It&#39;s one of the downsides of capitalism: once an item becomes marketable, sellers are going to find a way to provide it for the least amount of effort and expense on their part and buyers, after becoming dependent on buying instead of making, will adapt to whatever downgrade provided.  Don&#39;t get me wrong - I am extremely grateful for the scientists and researchers who have worked to make food more abundant and available than ever, but it has been at a cost.  We have occasionally had a garden, and I&#39;ve always just assumed my weight loss during harvest was due to the extra physical exertion, but now I realize that a lot of it probably had to do with the fact that my house was so full of fresh veg, I didn&#39;t have room for junk food lol.
This has opened up my eyes I really needed to hear this thx for the video and I have been experiencing with my own issues at stake because of how I keep struggling with how other people keep telling me to lose weight
⚠️READ THIS ITS IMPORTANT ⚠️ For those that don’t know here’s what she did she skinny shamed a sixteen yr old that had an eating disorder she made a video with her twin who had cancer for the second time and titled it “ who’s healthier now?” She also blamed her sister with a drug addiction for making her fat she doesn’t deserve her sisters or your praise so please stop defending her
So this realty show has turned from two sisters losing weight into the daily awful behavior of Tammy&#39;s??
as someone who conciders herself a BEAUTIFULL pluz size women, i loved listening to this, and not only that, but relating and noticing that it happens to everyone. and i love what you guys do to the industry and what you represent
So… I’m size 12-16 … and all I heard is that I’m skinny 🎉😂
I appreciate that emphasized that Schenee is exhibiting behaviors that we all have plenty of experience with. You&#39;re not talking about her as if she is impossible to relate to, even to the extent of explaining her cruel treatment of her husband as a symptom of her denial. Very classy way of presenting the subject matter.
Ok ummm why are yall mad about this,  there are brands that only do black shades and deep tones and everyone loves it but heaven forbid a white person make a foundation collection that is light toned...i don&#39;t get it. we are all the same they can make only white shades and they can make only black shades. get over it find another foundation. Plus the brand isn&#39;t saying &quot;this foundation has every single shade ever made and we has all shades for everyone!!&quot; they never said that they said &quot;we are gonna make a foundation collection.&quot; chill people. stop acting like this is the worst thing ever and they need to be cancelled because honestly yall acting like that is the only foundation on earth and we will all die if there are more white shades then black shades.
DONT SUPPORT HER SHE SKINNY SHAMED HER OWN SISTER WITH CANCER EHAT KIND OF PERSON DOES THAT😔😡
Hope lady loses the weight glad she trying
the tea confiscated my tub of cocoa butter for being a tiny bit oversized
Well… if she skinny shames then I would definitely replace the “i” in “fit” with another vowel
Butter in cereal sounds really gross
So all of this overweight was was basically your doing?
I am a stay at home mom and I am struggling. I gained weight before having my son and after I lost the baby weight quickly, but cannot lose the weight I gained before. He eats three meals a day and snacks so I&#39;m constantly cooking. I catch myself eating with him even though I&#39;m not hungry,  and I cook nutritious well rounded meals for him but I don&#39;t deprive him of pastas or occasional treats so I am exposed to those things. It is strange how I will monitor his eating but cannot seem capable of doing it for myself. I was always athletic and healthy in high-school but can&#39;t seem to care enough to get this under control. After years of always monitoring my eating I think I&#39;m over it, bored of it? I&#39;m not sure but I&#39;m frustrated with myself for sure.
Just one container of that Campbell’s chunky New england… is 390 kcal, wtf
I have a question watching this: where does this family get the money to be able to live like this? I am in South Africa and if you are disabled you MAY get a tiny amount of money. If you cannot work then you are totally reliant on others - and with the exception of the pretty well off family, there certainly would NOT be money for any of that junk food, let alone the huge van, chairs, wheelchairs, beds, equipment and all the things I see here. Do folks in the States get given government grants when this overweight?
This show was usually aired in January, like all the other weight loss shows (fat families, biggest loser etc) to take advantage of people and their new year resolutions.<br>If you need to wait for a certain date to make a change guys, you won&#39;t make that change. Join a gym in November. Don&#39;t live to excess in December. By the time January comes, it&#39;ll be easy to just carry on. And you will carry on.
I&#39;m not pregnant, but I do know the feeling of running out of breathe when doing these exercises as a plus size woman😅. I also love how much energy and positivity you have while you&#39;re exercising, it&#39;s a booster that some, like myself can use as motivation 🙌🏼
Fit check?!?<br>More like fat check 💀💀💀
Always excuses. If you are fat it is your own fault. There is nothing more to it. Sure, everyone has a story, but that doesn&#39;t change the basics.

Skeletal difference also.
😔SPREAD THIS😡<br><br>At this point,people fill jaimie&#39;s comments with hate and many people dont know what happened and where she gets this hate:<br>She skinny shamed 16yr olds,aswell saying that her 8yr old sister with c@ncer is her cause of being &quot;fat&quot; and naming the video WhO&#39;s HeAlThIeR nOw? Now the video is deleted even though we wish that she will STILL give an apology,not to us but these people and her sister. So dont say StOp ThE hAtE,thanks,get informed first.
⚠️GUYS LISTEN⚠️ she is a terrible person so Jamie had skinny shamed people in her deleted videos don’t say things to support her and I do not hate fat or chubby people it’s the truth
This is disgusting. I am a woman and I find this repulsiveIt is a matter of hygiene to remove hair from the armpit and bikini. I do not mind if you have body hair such as hands and legs
The reason they&#39;re denied a job: too fat to do the job<br>the reason they&#39;re denied Healthcare: they&#39;re fat and unhealthy which is a liability <br>sure we shouldn&#39;t shame people but it is even more detrimental to affirm that obesity is beautiful and healthy<br>stop being dillusional.
I dint know what&#39;s more: &quot;depressing or plain stupidity&quot;. Peorple like this woman, push for an ideal, which is actually more self defeating to their race/culture. Muslims in the U.S.A. is a perfect example. Muslims in this country are here, because it&#39;s a better life. The kind of life, the world of Islam which would deny them all the freedoms and prosperities they take for granted here! As for gays, feminists and far lefts? Don&#39;t even get me started.
The food industry has NOTHING to do with children being obese. Healthy food options are out there. Obese children are a direct result of lazy parents. Period.
college has become a status check for most people. There&#39;s so many books and videos online, plus 90% of what I learned in college, I never used again after college.
Bro they can&#39;t get some jobs cause their too fat and cat do the job
speaking as a fat guy myself... yes, if a person is overweight, they are eating far too much.
Dr. Rob Cywes talks a lot about carb-addiction and stress-management. <br>And he never blames fat people, he meats them where they are. <br>He makes them eat KETO or CARNIVORE while trains them to part with their &quot;best friend&quot; - carbohydrate that comes in all shapes, forms and tastes.<br>Never good to blame the victims.
&quot;Fat acceptance&quot; is one of the most dangerous, toxic subcultures in the world - I think Fat Acceptance is more dangerous then racism. Fat acceptance is all about convincing people that it&#39;s perfectly fine to kill yourself with cheeseburgers. Absolutely disgusting.
Why make a video of this? <br>You get fat, that&#39;s all!
Hi, Love your video,  What are the two lipsticks by  L&#39;oreal Plump and shine did you buy I want those colors please?
This is not going to work out. Skinny shaming a 16-year-old is not OK.
I don’t care if your rude. I love you just the way you are. Just because you did rude things doesn’t mean you can’t change. Although, it is mean shaming us skinny. But still, we all should be a little more supportive. Give her the courage to get strong and skinny. Either way, this song is for you. <br>Sincerely, Young Layla. ❤
IMPORTANT MESSAGE A Jamie has skinny shamed so many people in one of her deleted videos she was was next to her TWIN sister who had CANCER and captioned it<br>&quot;Who&#39;s healthier now?&quot; She&#39;s and awful person. Don&#39;t try to defend her. She doesn&#39;t deserve it. She has said so many awful things and acts like an angel. Why would you say<br>&quot;aww slayy so beautiful.&quot; Or<br>&quot;your so pretty never let anybody bring you down!&quot; When she honestly doesn&#39;t deserve it.<br>If she acted differently and was a good person then sure, support her but she isn&#39;t she&#39;s an awful human
I ate a lot a few hours ago so me seeing this thick burrito 🌯   made me sick 🤢
When I think of women, I think of women with big breasts and big hips. I prefer and love overweight women ... but I&#39;m curious about the names of these ladies. and I want to reach them.
Putting aside the issue of gender, why is it wrong to put &quot;parent&quot; instead of &quot;mom&quot;? Mothers are parents and have been long before we starting talking about gender. Plus the paper didn&#39;t say &quot;What does your kid call you?&quot; But what the relationship is... Well she is the parent. Not legal gurdian, not grand parent... But parent. Why focus on what the kid calls her?
Hi, Love your video,  What are the two lipsticks by  L&#39;oreal Plump and shine did you buy I want those colors please?
nothing to see here but obesity, she&#39;s a model? Very unhealthy weight...her BMI would place her in the obese category...not a good role model at all!
u are right...<br>but beeng fat is ur self? <br>sound like an excusee to eat
Get some professional help. How is he disgusting for asking israel to exercise restraint when it’s butchering civilians. You really need help
What size are you in the cargo’s? ❤❤love it
you should talk about her recent weight loss, she looks great!
Ur so fat the neighbours lock there fridges at night
when i was losing weight, a lot of ppl in my family did as well. the entire time one of my family members was telling me he was doing it “right” by restricting and overworking himself. few years later i’ve kept the majority of my weight off and he’s gained most of it back. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I can give you some tips if you want. You can reduce daily upto 500 grams weight per day.
Therapy is the best way to help with weight loss when it comes to adults and children; at least when the weight comes from something like an Eating Disorder or lack of Motivation. <br>Obesity disorder is usually a snake that eats itself; it’s a cycle that keeps getting compacted as everyone calls them disgusting things. <br>It can’t be fixed in a 4-12 week camp. That’s why they do these disgusting “quick fixes” for children; they show immediate short term results but many will NEVER reach their long term goals because none of these kids are really getting their true problems addressed.
No, you want superiority. Feminism is disgusting and it is destroyed. The family caused massive fatherlessness and confusion.
What was the point you dont need to bring up the fact your plus sized i mean be proud of yourself but like this trend is for everyone there wasnt a point be proud of yourself without making others feel bad not everyone body shames plus sized so you shoudnt body shame skinnys
How about all those fat old people… Oh yeah, there aren’t any.
BS video... As a percentage the rich pay nothing, most of their income is from capital gains and business income which has loopholes the size of Texas to hide money
There are disgusting black racists, they say things like whites out of Africa and Africa for Africans. And Kill Whites
Even though she is fat her personality makes her more beautiful
𝙁𝙪𝙣 𝙁𝙖𝙘𝙩: Doner kebab (döner kebap) is originally a Turkish food. It&#39;s often served with bread instead of fries, which saves you from a considerable amount of fat. Also, if you keep the melted butter out as well, the doner kebab can be pretty healthy, especially if you cook it yourself. I used to cook it almost every week and I still remained slim and healthy🤷‍♀️
It would be great if you go over &quot;super-sized vs superskinny&quot; series.
here is honestly what has been helping me lose weight......... dont only do cardio...... do weights to or more..... cardio gets boring to do and when something is not interesting your mind loses interest there are so many weight techinques  that your body doesnt really adapt and you will burn calories
I feel like black people are on average skinnier than white people. At least here in Houston Texas, where there is no shortage of fat ass white people. I&#39;m going to take note from now on when in public because I think my hypothesis is correct. In houston I&#39;d say fat people out weigh (pun intended) skinny people probably 10 to 1.
Body positivity is not just for fat people. There are any number of groups for that. They have their spaces, so they need to stop trying to gate keep what is for other people.
She looks like a thick Eva Mendes but hotter. I likey!
Plus size model forever...👌👌🌷🌷
Kiana Docherty is currently my favorite youtube channel in helping me lose weight. Thanks for the great content!
it&#39;s the same thing for people who are underweight anorexic too. Many of them will say &quot;I&#39;m healthy&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s a lifestyle&quot;, or even &quot;I&#39;m not underweight&quot;-- or worse &quot;I&#39;m fat!&quot; They don&#39;t believe they&#39;re withering away. They believe they&#39;re the most obese person in the room. Eating disorders are all like that, based in self-deception and delusion. It&#39;s also just like a food addiction, only on the opposite end of the spectrum. Instead of lying to others that they&#39;re on a diet, anorexic nervosa patients will lie that they did eat, and they&#39;ll lie to you, me, their parents, their doctors, everyone. The real question is... how does one even talk to someone who is delusional (whether they&#39;re deluded into not believing their overweight or underweight)? How does one get them to see that they&#39;re severely underweight, that they need help, or that they can die at any moment because of it? I don&#39;t know the answer. All I know is that it&#39;s sad. For many addicts that recover, sometimes it&#39;s not even a matter of hitting &quot;rock bottom&quot;. They say that addicts will change when they want to change.  So how can we even begin to help anorexic or obese people see their unhealthiness? Delusions are just that-- no amount of data or proof will undo a delusion. The person themself will have to be the one to overcome it. I don&#39;t know one person on this planet that knows how to hurry up that &quot;overcome delusion&quot; process, though, in order to save lives.
Meh. Amy  it&#39;s hypocritical to equate  and assume that your skinny friends mean they&#39;re starving or suffering. And I&#39;ve heard her talk skinny this, skinny that in other talks. You don&#39;t need to make assumptions about other women just because it&#39;s not your body.
⚠️ ATTENTION EVERYONE THIS MESSAGE IS IMPORTANT PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING⚠️<br><br><br><br><br><br>Jaimie skinny-shamed a 16-year-old. She stood next to her sister who had cancer TWICE and titled it &quot;Who&#39;s healthier now?&quot; It is not okay. She deleted the videos, and continues on with regular day life, refusing to give those poor people an apology, we don&#39;t need one, THEY DO. I also think we shouldn&#39;t make fun of her. What she did was absolutely terrible and not okay whatsoever. But let&#39;s not become as evil as her by fat-shaming her. Please, let&#39;s try not to fat-shame her, no matter what she did. They need an apology, but we shouldn&#39;t fat-shame while asking for one. Thank you for your time.
Hahaha little she knows that staying at home it is a job too. A 24/7 work plus work. Precious and fulfilling 🧡
WE DEMAND A APOLOGY. SKINNY SHAMING A 16 YEAR OLD IS NOT COOL STOP BEING SO INNOCENT AND SHOW HOW MEAN U ARE ALL BOYS AND GIRLS ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL BODYS TOO. Here is why: she made a vid or smh with her sister who has cancer and made fun of how skinny she is and asked who is healthier.
Vanessa needs to figure why she overeats (to put it mildly); and discover what normal eating is. She has a toxic relationship with food.
Justice is selective and freedom is dead, fuck the police, the judges, and the brain-dead idiots who elect them
Then lose weight
As a horseback rider, she does not follow the 20 percent rule..And tiny Shetland to a Draft it doesn’t matter. plus who tf wears a dress on a horse unless you are gonna do a photo shoot 💀
I don’t get how an overweight man is getting to walk around calling people fatties 🤦‍♂️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFHqiHQgF8&amp;t=3m47s">3:47</a> it means that having 0/ body fat is not healthy BUT HAVING 500 POUNS OF FAT ITS NOT HEALTY EATHER
SORRY BUT FAT CAMP 😂😝 does that even exist? 🫢 btw we demand and apology Jamie body shaming a 16 year old is not ok and captioning at the vid where ur lil sister has cancer with “who’s healthier now 😆” not ik Jamie
Guys if you don’t understand why people are sending hate comments is bc that Jaimie did some bad things that are so wrong so basically she skinny shamed a 16 yrs old that didn’t do anything and she mocked her sister l think but her sister had cancer and she said “ who’s healthier now” l think but yea l hope that made sense!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Edit: apologized Jaimie<br><br><br><br><br><br>Edit2: if you can’t found the videos then she probably deleted them so she doesn’t get any hate so l don’t have poof but lk this bc l saw this
You luck freaken ugly
Ur not fat ur beautiful
DAAMNNN!!! She&#39;s old looking! I&#39;m 45 and don&#39;t look like that. She looks at LEAST 10 years older than she is, before and after weight.
Black, brown, white, fat, skinny, tall, short, rich, poor, male, female!! We are all the same underneath, we all feel shame, which is beyond ridiculous. But thank god for some of the stronger beautiful successful people who have put themselves out into the light and helped us feel that maybe, just maybe, someone will believe that is was not our fault. Tears fall as I write this and I feel so much respect and love for you beautiful woman. Thank you thank you, let us all remember our humanity. Hold on to your kind hearts ♥️
It’s not that she doesn’t want to give up overeating and smoking, it’s that she wants to keep her self harm. We assume that as a species we always want to live and thrive, but that’s not necessarily the case.
Eh - not a fan of Diet Coke.  Back in the day, my only option was Tab which to this day, I miss although never to the extent of liters a day.  I actually prefer Pepsi Zero because it&#39;s sweeter.  Some of the Coke Zero flavors are palatable and others are downright disgusting (ergo Y3K).  If anything, the primary reason for the addiction is caffeine of course.  I will drink Diet or Zero Sugar Coke if nothing else is available (has to be zero sugar due to T1D) although I&#39;m just as likely to drink unsweetened iced tea which again is caffeine.  Usually, soda in cans is not as good as soda in bottles (for myself) and it matters where you get it, the amount of syrup being used, and the expiration (which yes, there is one).  If anything, I consider myself addicted to carbonation as I can just as easily drink club soda.  The biggest reason I prefer Pepsi Zero (or diet) is because it&#39;s seemingly more consistent with the flavor.  Some Coke Zero or Diet was randomly just disgusting whether purchased at a store or a restaurant.  Just personal experience though.
Guys no matter what she did in the past we still have to be nice to her no matter her size hate can do so many things to people
I was a size 1 in high school and still found it hard to find pants that fit me at Abercrombie.  I always wondered who could actually wear the pants from there.  This was 1999 and the early 2000’s
Can u do a commentary on someone who lost tons and tons of  weight and....gained it back?
I use to get jack in the box once a week, same thing, love it, like 10 years straight. No weeks off. Did a diet, lost a bunch of weight. Went on a road trip and stopped to get that same meal. It was about noon. Hadn’t had it in like 7 months. Got on the road about 30 minutes later, I felt like I was gonna fall asleep. The crash was always scary. Don’t think I’ve had that meal since, maybe 9 years ago. 😊
I&#39;ve recently tried skipping out on breakfast and lunch and just eating a big meal at the end of the day, semi keto, semi carnivore but I do allow for some sweets.  I gave tried calorie tracking before and meal prepping but having to have lunches packed and ready everyday takes a lot of effort, it&#39;s easier for me to buy some steak and eggs or salmon, freeze it. Let it thaw then come home after working and have a nice big meal. It&#39;s more convenient for me than planning out an entire weeks worth of meals and making sure I bring something to lunch because when I miss a day I still feel like I need to eat at work so I&#39;ll grab lunch, or get a snack and it&#39;ll cause me to fall off the wagon. <br>Yes, this message is scattered. Last year I started watching your videos and felt inspired to lose weight. I tracked calories diligently for about 4 months and lost about 40lbs.but the demands of my job caught up, I was working a lot of double and mg sleep was suffering, I didn&#39;t have time to prep meals I was stressed and decided to just give up and started eating out again. Id stopped going in mg afternoon walks, I stopped trying. I gained everything back and that makes it so much harder to want to try again because I know just how long it will take to get back to where I was i think the secret may be to not just stick to one approach. Calorie counting or intermittent fasting or a particular diet. But to be adaptive to change. Right now the 1 meal a day strategy seems to be working but I feel like I need to be flexible thanks for reading if indeed you did and I love your channel
Can you guys shut up and stop fat shameing please it&#39;s not good for you no ones gonna like people who gat shame
✨spend a day with your body positive bestie✨ girl you literally skinny shame people 😂 glad I don’t know you I’m so skinny 😂
love these two women but they dont really have the average life.. missing a childs steps, well that is part of your chosen path..at home mums see that but we gave up our career to be there at all times. Traveling with children, take toys and games that engage them and be prepared to be engaged with them at all times of the journey (did this for years with my 3 traveling solo with them back and forth across the pond)..and yes breast feeding you keep some fat to produce milk.
This makes no sense??? She’s acting like a plus size person can’t eat good and healthy food(vegetables)
Very interesting to see a wh*te woman wag her finger at these beautiful strong bipoc kings and queens. Fat shaming is very much alive, and this “documentary” proves it.
nothing to see here but obesity, she&#39;s a model? Very unhealthy weight...her BMI would place her in the obese category...not a good role model at all!
Holy crap. I am a type 1 Diabetic and I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s actually endocrinology why I see my blood sugar tank when I&#39;m cooking a meal I&#39;m really anticipating and I&#39;m &quot;starving&quot; by the time I finally sit down. I&#39;ve learned to be careful not to overeat on accident. I&#39;m one of those people, I guess. I have a continuous glucose monitor and it&#39;s been wild watching the patterns over the last three years after drastically changing my lifestyle. Let&#39;s just say I took my a1C from a 10 to a 6.0. My other stat I&#39;m proud of is going from 260 lbs to 180, and still going. I&#39;m also frankly disappointed in my care team for never giving me half as much information as was contained in this video. I had to figure out that high glycemic index foods spike my blood sugar myself and do research on what foods wouldn&#39;t on my own. I got there eventually. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m healthier now at 35 than I was at 25 😉 Thanks for letting me toot my horn a little. Genuinely fantastic video!
I went from being anorexic in my teens and early 20&#39;s to binge eating in my near my 40&#39;s...  I&#39;m so confused! I feel lost and like I have no idea what diet I need. What foods should I eat and/or cut and what amount of calories should I consume for the day? Every place I try to get info from says something different and I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore :( I also have PCOS, which I&#39;m not trying to make an excuse for by any means, I just realize that it complicates things a little more. I really liked this video and I&#39;m going to try to follow your guide and see what happens. Thank you!!
Fat
Fat n stupid is a bad combination
I’m rouge do I placed my order on Friday at 3 am and I kind of blacked out and today this HUGE BOX arrived I mean the box is half of my body size and I’m 5’6 lol my mom said damn did you BUY SEPHORA 😂
I think it&#39;s clear that with 73.4% of us being OVERWEIGHT or OBESE, more people couldn&#39;t CARE LESS about even looking DECENT much less being actively beautiful.  People aren&#39;t EVEN TRYING!
Many of the problems humans have are because society have developed faster than the human brain. The human brain looks for food. It used to be hard to get food.. therefore no overeating. Nowadays we have an abundance of food at our fingertips, all the time. So the human brain thinks &quot;must eat and store fat for the time there&#39;s a lack of food&quot;. Our brains haven&#39;t developed fast enough.
I will have to try the true skin again I found it heavy and too thick and sank into fine lines for me I really wanted to love that foundation maybe I should try the infallable I have the nude don&#39;t like it true match meh lol maybe I just expect foundation to be too skin like and it doesn&#39;t exist
fun fact , if you just dance around while playing music you can lose alot of weight. i dont do any real styles but just copy 1% of what belly dancer do and youll have alot of fun. also check out different indian schools of dance. if youre religious or non specific religious , i highly recommend it. alot of indian dance is actually prayers, thank yous, and blessings to gods. whenever i dance , i like to imagine myself at the foot of a behemoth throne , gold and surrounded by clouds, and my creator watches over me as i dance for them like a baby horse learning to walk. it brings me great joy. and i hope it bring you joy as well. my heart is pounding from happiness
you already are plus size😂😂😂
the only possible way to lose weight is to decompose
Chanel balm looks really really good and looks like it stains! <br>Plus it looks like a really big pot. I’d love to get that!
It&#39;s clear her panties are definitely a few sizes too small!
High fat low carb is the best at controlling blood sugar and normalizing appetite
I’ve always struggled with weight fluctuations and it’s always been in an unhealthy way. 10 years ago I lost a lot of weight because I had to be healthy due to being pregnant but after I had my child I didn’t keep it off and went back to bad habits again. Fast forward to now and I have a greater understanding on how to be healthier, I’ve lost about 5kg (11lb) give or take in the last month and I feel like I’m absolutely on the right track. I’m a lot happier and am proud of myself for gaining the strength to do this. What annoys me is that when I was at my heaviest people would tell me I looked fine and that I’m not fat etc when I clearly was LOL.

Ashley fr amazing 🤩🤩 straight up bs that when she lose any typa weight ppl start hating. Let her live her mf life 😤
It&#39;s always the ugly guys who want to judge everyone else&#39;s looks and women for being overweight
I don&#39;t like to body shame anyone but she deserves it for stuff she did if she can skinny shame we can fat shame..😑<br>She literally thinks being healthy and having cancer is same😳👀
Jamie’s father: your mom died<br>Jamie: Yes! Finally I get to wear my funeral outfit!
Lose some weight just kidding your perfect the way you are no one should judge you
This is a lifelong struggle that I just can&#39;t seem to conquer, especially while living with a husband who eats like a horse right in front of me all the time. I have zero support, and outside support is so very important for successful long-term weight loss.
Maybe Jamie should start doing weight checked instead of fit checks😁
I just don’t get the whole “ don’t be so hard on yourself, let go of perfectionism and don’t linger on numbers” “don’t be so strict and cut out entire foods” but then it’s “ you have to be in a caloric deficit or else you won’t lose weight.” “White, processed foods are your worst enemy”. It’s so mentally exhausting. I lost weight 6 years ago and gained double it. I lost 40 lbs last year, and I still enjoyed the foods I loved, but managed to regain 30 of those lbs in the last few months. I’m so lost and helpless, I don’t know.
Throughout history, young men of all races, religions, and creeds have been forcibly removed from their homes and sent to their deaths... and the care they&#39;ve received post war has never been adequate. I&#39;m not saying men have had it harder... but comparing the trials of men and women throughout history is moronic and until we stop this trivial polarization on all fronts we are doomed to collapse
Those breakfast sandwiches sound disgusting
Imagine taking a trailer that is built to take 1 ton &amp; loading it with 3 tons of rubble. You can imagine what the result will be. So what makes these people think they can pile on weight without putting extra strain on their joints, organs or feet specifically? I can feel the change when I just put on 10kgs. I can&#39;t imagine being 50 or 100kgs over.
How many 600 lb actors are there actually? You could not have this film without a fat suit. Like you said expecting an actor to gain that much weight is insane. So, in this situation I am pro fat suit.
This girl skinny Shames and makes fun of her dying sister! i’m subscribed to her…
I&#39;ve never been able to work out if Jesse is genuine crazy or if he&#39;s just playing to be funny. He got brought on uk tv once , ITV GMB, biggest daily news show, not long after George Floyd died and he was cut off after about 10 seconds because all he said was .....<br>&quot; Black lives matter was founded by fat, black lesbiens!&quot; <br>Cut. 😂😂😂😂
ik it&#39;s scripted to an extent but goddamn<br>also<br>their personality makes them so ugly
This is why all my friends were guys! Starting from middle school girls started treating me like this and even my mom to this day! I took it a a learning lesson to never be like that because it makes you such a ugly person no matter how beautiful you are.
Who is the British person responsible for arbitrating the weight of “a stone”?
The issue is that the challenge is significantly more in favor of the super skinny, super skinnies can eat as much or as little as they want having the large portion where as the super size gets nothing to work with.
A moment of silence for the horse who attempted at the worlds heaviest weight lifting 😔
These so-called women are beyond disgusting and pathetic.
Hello, thanks for your amazing work ❤<br><br>At 35 years old, and as a former bulimic, binge eater, emotional eater, i agree with what you said in this video.<br><br>The importance of sleep is SO neglected. I can tell that good sleeping TOTALLY changes the whole f* game with hunger, and mood thoughout the day. Nearly one year now, that i go to bed at 10.30 pm and wake up at 7 am, more or less. I feel less anxious, and i can eat peacefully my first meal at 1pm. I&#39;m not hungry at all in the morning, eating in the morning makes me feel bad and nauseous, which allows me to experiment intermittent fasting, allowing my digestive system to rest. And it&#39;s soothing my mind.<br><br>While i was searching for tips to stop bingeating, a nice advice, a bit bisturbing at the beginning, was &quot;having a full nice meal&quot;. A good plate. The one that allows you to feel you&#39;ve eaten well (a nice way to eat a loooot of vegetables) without shame. And it worked, for me. No need to throw back my meals anymore, no need to worry about blowing a fuse anymore and open the fridge and food storage and make a carnage anymore. I&#39;d rather eat a big plate than eating all day long.<br><br>I don&#39;t eat a lot of white sugar, cakes and sweets anymore. Just from time to time, and they taste now so nasty. I eat very dark chocolate, one or two biscuits with my coffee for lunch, and one after my dinner with my herbal, spiced infusion, or green tea...<br><br>Drink a lot. Coffee or tea in the morning. Green tea, and natural organic infusions (no flavors, no artificial flavors), i recommend the pukka ones or yogi tea. And WATER.<br><br>Vegetal food helped me a LOT. Not that i don&#39;t want to eat meat, but i don&#39;t see the point, in putting bad quality meat in my body. A poor earthling suffered his life long, and in the end, the industry adds flavors, and sugars, salt, and coloring, and conservative additives, and &quot;spice extracts&quot; (not even just spice, no, spice extracts...😳) Etc. From time to time i eat good quality meat, when I find some. Organic local eggs and fresh goat cheese are delicous too.<br><br>Exercising also helped me a lot to have a feeling of clarified mind, wich was very sweet and agreable. Less pain, the satisfaction of evolving and succeeding in doing stuff that you weren&#39;t able to do before, feeling your blood circling fast all inside instead of watching TV or being depressed in your bed... Stretching....... Bliss<br><br>Small habits helps... Washing my teeth when I&#39;m done eating, helped me too, it means &quot;eating is over&quot;. And I just go and do something else, Reading, drawing, painting, working......... And it&#39;s satisfiying to focus on something, without interrupting yourself with the pulse go to the f* fridge, and again start eating like there&#39;s no tomorrow.<br><br>Reading labels, food composition is a reflex now, and when I see that the list is long, with added sugar and useless stuff where there should&#39;nt be, i don&#39;t buy the product and i don&#39;t miss it at all. I hope you, American Friends, are able to find healthy stuff, not expensive as f*, and not polluted as f*.<br><br>Now i tell myself that i experimented fast and junk food, and normal food too, in waaaaaaay tooo enormous amounts well enough, and now, it&#39;s time to just eat simple stuff, and that&#39;s delicious and healthy.<br><br>I also told myself that wasting all of my money on so many food was insane. It lasted about 12 years.... 😳<br><br>My throat that began to hurt all the time, my nasty breath, and the horrible stomach pain the day after, worried me and disgusted me of what I was inflicting to my body, mind, soul, etc.<br><br>The last time the dentist told me that my teeth were quite used for my age...<br><br>My liver hurting strangely (a kind of strange pain and heavy weight on the right side of the bust, and the caracteristic breath that comes with liver problems, so good ❤) also helped me realize and BEING AWARE (being aware and conscious also is very very important) that i would die sooner than scheduled in atrocious pain.<br><br>I can say that I&#39;m done with binge eating or throwing back my food. Losing weight was my goal when this nightmare began to intensify, now my weight is stable, even if i am just a little overweight. It doesn&#39;t matter. Food is still important to me, but I&#39;m not obsessed anymore. And from time to time, i eat half a pizza, or ice cream with delight, and that&#39;s ok, no shame, no guilt, no nothing. I&#39;m done. I&#39;m in f* P.E.A.C.E.<br><br>I wish to all of you that struggle everyday with this s* to get out of it, to find your way out of the dark. It&#39;s possible, it&#39;s sometimes messy as f* but in the end it works. And you&#39;ll be f* proud that this s* is far behind. Be strong 💪 You Can Do It. You deserve PEACE.
How about thinking logically for a change? <br>Confused Mind Vs healthy body?<br>The woke West is in a trans mental-heath pandemic where castrating a heathy body is seen as a viable solution for a befuddled mind.  Starting from an early age, otherwise heathy individuals are being indoctrinated to think they&#39;re she&#39;s and/or not he&#39;s, while another small minority think their Asians, aliens, amputees, athletes, anorexics and animals in the wrong body.<br> So be honest, do you really think we could cure a befuddled, confused mind by mutilatimg a healthy body? Don&#39;t you have to know the difference between male and female anatomy to be convinced you&#39;re in the wrong body? So if it&#39;s not Biology as trans activists claim, and all in your mind, why change ur appearance at all? Can&#39;t u be happily living  out such a delusion without looking in a mirror, right? You erroneously claim it&#39;s not biology but mere thoughts or feelings. But don&#39;t thoughts emanate from your brain chemistry, an organ too? So it is biological Well!
Bro is the size of the museum
I noticed the models that are plus size always have the most refined jaws no double chins I believe this makes a difference if you want to be a plus size model.
I actually never got the impression that you hate anyone from your videos.<br><br>And why would you hate obese people if you once were overweight yourself.<br><br>People get so easily offended these days, it’s crazy.<br><br>I’m overweight myself but your videos inspire me to get back into shape.

But it’s their choice to be fat? I don’t get it
Honestly, super thick nose is really hot on him
This is an excellent chat. I&#39;ve been watching this podcast for some time now, but none of the other episodes (no shade) have hit me like this one. I&#39;m going through my own path of forgiveness and I didn&#39;t have the true connection between forgiveness and freedom but now it&#39;s so apparent. I&#39;m excited to catapult myself into this forgiveness so I, too, can rid myself of the shackles of non-forgiveness.
It always saddens me when people talk about glycemic index but not glycemic load! Glycemic index is calculated based on 50g of carbohydrates for all foods. With raw carrots for example, one entire POUND of carrots is only 45g of carbs, so to get the GI measurement they accounted for more than an entire pound of carrots. What&#39;s the last time you sat down to a meal of more than a whole pound of carrots? Glycemic load takes serving sizes into account, so for glycemic load they might take a measurement based on 2 small raw carrots, for example, rather than over a pound of carrots. GI is still a good metric to look at, but it doesn&#39;t give an accurate picture because it doesn&#39;t factor in realistic serving sizes.
Its lazy parenting of give them what they want to shut them up. Lack of effort is the main issue these days not to mention the plethora of excuses that have come to fruition thanks to the body positive BS. Fats disgusting not brave, stop giving yourselfs false titles when your choosing to make zero effort in exercising or nutrition.
My father’s company Whitesmiles sponsored this song, in the beginning Jeffrey picked up his tooth whitening product, my dad paid 10,000 dollars for this
I hate to say this because freedom of speech and freedom of the press were once critical in the truth being known and to hold people accountable.  But, we are heading towards our very freedoms being the tools of evildoers to expedite our once great country&#39;s downfall.<br><br>Our tolerance invites radicals who utilize our freedoms to work against us. Countries like China, Russia, and Iran use our freedoms against us via the internet.  <br><br>At some point we need strong leaders need to formulate a plan to identify the evil and put measures in place to disallow these groups from using our freedoms against us.  For the good of our nation the Left and Right will need to put in place safeguards not to allow one political Party to silence the other. If we don&#39;t do something like this, it&#39;s only a matter of time before we collapse.  Just as someone can&#39;t shout &quot;FIRE&quot; in a crowded theater, we need to ban and enforce bans against actions harming our country.
Women don’t wanna be wives and grow with someone these days. They’d rather post sexy pictures online and get attention and hook up with random dudes and find them self until they’re in their 30s and father time is beating on their front door and then all the sudden they want to be mommy and wife now. But they have all the trauma and past sexual relationships with men don’t see them as a viable mother option and they probably aren’t which is why we see all these issues that are happening now. Women have a license to kill and that license is called abortion or women have killed their own babies in the bubonic plague killed
Haven&#39;t seen the movie, haven&#39;t really been interested, but now you have made me curious.  From what you have shared, it seems like it is a pretty accurate description of what you can expect if you become extremely obese.  I always have to remind myself that &quot;phobia&quot; doesn&#39;t just mean an abnormal fear of something, but also an abnormal repulsion.  There is nothing abnormal about fearing the effects of obesity and depression and nothing abnormal about repulsion towards someone killing themselves.  Now those who simply look at an overweight/ non-ideal body and say &quot;eww, gross!&quot; simply because it&#39;s not pleasing to their eyes, they are fat phobic, but I daresay they are also in the minority. Most people look with empathy and understanding, concerned for the well being of others.<br><br>I really enjoyed your insights on how the food culture/industry of the US is affecting our health. I used to live in a city with a wide variety of restaurants everywhere, and now live in a rural area where, aside from a half dozen or so fast food joints (most of which I loathe), there are even less restaurants that have food that even rarely appeals to me. Those facts have not stopped me from picking up food at least for my husband once or twice a week.  We live outside the delivery area for pizza and AFAIK Door Dash doesn&#39;t reach us, and I&#39;ve never really thought about how we should be grateful for that instead of being annoyed that we have to get fully dressed, leave our home, and drive 30 minutes to grab junk.
Your so fat that you broke the staircase to heaven original: MDU
WE DEMAND A APOLOGY. SKINNY SHAMING A 16 YEAR OLD IS NOT COOL STOP BEING SO INNOCENT AND SHOW HOW MEAN U ARE ALL BOYS AND GIRLS ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL BODYS TOO. Here is why: she made a vid or smh with her sister who has cancer and made fun of how skinny she is and asked who is healthier.
Of course it was...I dont see any heroin users positivity,just because like pronoting fat positivity, is not healty...AT ALL!
If obesity was good, wild animals would be obese.<br>Have you ever seen a fat lion?
Bet she&#39;d look like Wednesday fattie
If you&#39;ve been fat before you would definitely know when a fat person is bullshitting because you used to think the same way more or less. I guess that&#39;s the reason why people think she “hates” fat people. I dont think she hates fat people, she&#39;s just tired of hearing those bullshit ass excuses over and over lol. She hates the fact that many of them are just in denial.
Lose weight..easy, STOP EATING.
&quot;I have no control over what he eats&quot; bs...you buy the food...you can lock the cupboards, you control the portion size, ...yeah, you can control what the kid eats!
In nature, fat bodies dont exist... we engineered fat people
being truly confident means not shaming others for their weight as well sis. <br><br>big or small…
Many people here as well as on her other videos are like do exercise, don&#39;t act sympathetic, don&#39;t look pity.  I&#39;m not judging ur intentions but sometimes nothing works, no one here knows her medical conditions ig.. Maybe she is trying maybe she is not.. So what.. It doesn&#39;t make her any less human. There are people making videos on their opinions n feelings,  people aren&#39;t joking there. So why her. She is sharing her life on her account. If u can&#39;t appreciate, no one asked u to bother. Most fat people shy away from sharing anything but she is sharing ig that&#39;s like overcoming one of the biggest fear. Also I&#39;m not encouraging unhealthy lifestyle but you can all act a bit human. If you really are that is.
This is not going to work out. Skinny shaming a 16-year-old is not OK.
&quot;My sister ruined our lives with her addiction issues&quot;<br><br>... Disgusting.
Of course.<br><br>Body positivity begun for victim of acid attack / fire survivor / trauma survivor and etc.<br><br>then fat people took over because it&#39;s easier to make everyone think fat is fine than to lose weight.<br><br>and now fatties are angry they aren&#39;t the only ones taking up all the space.
most people can just become more attractive. it&#39;s harder when your trans, as a woman that was not even allowed hormones, testosterone ruined my body forever. and it makes it impossible to look like what you <b>should</b> look like. It&#39;s harder to find jobs, its much harder to find partners, etc. <br><br>its ridiculous for us, even worse than normal cis people. But that said..... humans lived in tribes, most people in many years ago, all had good faces. modern day has changed our habits, how we move, how we chew, how we sit a lot, and it makes our faces look weird and abnormal. <br><br>In the past, you&#39;d know everybody and it reduces self esteem issues, plus most people all looked good.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFHqiHQgF8&amp;t=3m47s">3:47</a> it means that having 0/ body fat is not healthy BUT HAVING 500 POUNS OF FAT ITS NOT HEALTY EATHER
As a skinny person who’s been called “anorexic,twig,skin and bones,branch etc body shaming skinny people rlly does hurt just as much
Freedom seeds
ohhh! you mean the sister you skinny shamed?
Fat camp?? Looks like it didn&#39;t  work for you 😂😂😂
Disgusting!  I think the saddest part is the very public admission  of filth.   Soo gross!!
I think Google become fat activist.
People don&#39;t overeat because they don&#39;t know that overeating is bad. They overeat because they are addicted to the comfort of food. People become addicts because of trauma. They will never stop being fat until they learn a better way to deal with trauma.
she&#39;s defending fatties because they&#39;re the &quot;ugly friend&quot;.
These comments are savage bro 💀<br><br>BUT this is about the only okay way to fat shame someone, but skinny shaming a 16 year old is NOT OK, and fat shaming is not ok either, (not siding with Jamie here) I Just think everyone deserves a chance &lt;3
“Body positivity”<br>“I’m prettier and cooler”<br>Girl yo better shush. Your whole personality is being oversized.<br>Every. Single video.<br>“GRWM!!” Normal.. but just bcs she’s oversized she milks views. <br>“UNPACKING OVERSIZED CLOTHING” bruh
This woman is delusional.   Who told her she could give advice.  I wonder if she will ever play these videos back to see how dumb she sounds.  She might as well say I don&#39;t want to lose weight it&#39;s too hard.  I want to keep eating processed food and sugar all day so don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m going to die I rather be surprised with a heart attack.  I also don&#39;t want my Dr and friends to tell me I&#39;m going to die from my obesity problem.   There that sounds better
last time I checked, skinny - shaming and being extremely unhealthily fat isn&#39;t body positive.
That deep manly laugh.  Gross. <br>Those Chompers. <br>Noooo.  Just no
Girl you were so pretty you don’t need to be skinny. Everyone is pretty in their own ways and you’re the most prettiest person I’ve ever seen in my whole entire life. It doesn’t matter shapes or sizes. Everyone was built different and I want you to know that you are the most beautiful is person in the world if people don’t believe that then they’re insecure about yourself.
It’s okay to be fat - it’s not okay to be unhealthy -
You are not fat<br>You are so pretty
My take is &quot;fat positivity&quot; is just an extremist group that has given up on improving themselves. It is dedication and work to be healthy, but they are so incredibly insecure that they have to convince others, that are also overweight, that living this unhealthy life is more beneficial so they don&#39;t have to actually have to try work at anything. If they put as much energy in trying to convince people to stay on this path of self-destruction, imagine what they could do if they actually tried to lose the weight.
If somebody loses weight on this crazy diet, they certainly will lose water and muscles
I was in London just walking around noticing that there are attractive women and people in general compared to the US. Then it struck me how many fewer overweight people there were and that’s the reason.
As someone living in UK, I thought this show would make me lose weight and I’m still fat 13 years later 😂😂
I’m kinda surprised that google employees gained that much weight because I expected that google would work their employees so hard they wouldn’t have time to go for a snack
Carbs BECOME sugar to OBESE people. ACTUAL sugar vs carbs...BOTH result in visceral,organ crushing fat because their BROWN fat supply is TOO LOW...
Help lol I have not tried anything I was 21 walked into MAC and they colored matched my foundation I felt like a princess lol MAC studio sculpt spf foundation NC30 I think, but I feels heavy on me like if I need to put on a whole face of makeup then I use it. Also they pared it with medium plus mineralize I was 21 then and I’m 35 sad I need help I want something that makes me feel fresh easy on the coverage
⚠️READ THIS ITS IMPORTANT ⚠️ For those that don’t know here’s what she did she skinny shamed a sixteen yr old that had an eating disorder she made a video with her twin who had cancer for the second time and titled it “ who’s healthier now?” She also blamed her sister with a drug addiction for making her fat she doesn’t deserve her sisters so stop defending her
When your blood work on your hands and you pretty much understand what it says ... You have good enough motivation to loose weight
I tend to Boredom eating. Not much of a going out kinda person so it&#39;s get boring n when bored I tend to overeat. And when watching reels of eating food then hunger automatically comes. Which is like fake hunger not the actual one
Ironic, isn&#39;t it?   An American reporting on obese British children.  And where did McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, etc., come to Britain from?
You might be fat. But that means u have the biggest hart 💜💎
I am a burn victim. 20% of my body are in third and fourth degree burn marks with bone charring and nerve damage. I will be on pain medication for life of no miracle happens or is invented. A drunk driver crashed into my parents car. I had no fault in this and had to learn walking again. If I wear a bikini at the beach, people point fingers at me. Yet I am a size six now and was kicked out of the body positive movement after I went from roughly 280 to 128 pounds for my health. After all they say I can just cover my scars up and my body is still considered mainstream attractive. This is ridiculous. I can not do anything to change these burns, ever. They’re painful. Being 280 pounds was something I did myself and was able to change. I lost the weight because I had to as my already weak body couldn’t handle it anymore.
The problem is really that every place that European people conquered was because of the disease that traveled with them from shore to shore. <br><br>Not only that people actually lived peacefully and didn&#39;t think of word conquest. <br><br>Only the white race can face total extinction showing that their the ones marked in the Bible and they will remain in power until we remember our father face and from that point on black fathers were put into prison and the black mother was given government handouts to get rid of fathers. <br><br>Am lying?
This is the single biggest problem today is the little girls of 20 and 30 years ago that never had any discipline or guidance from their fathers are now adults and nothing but 304s.. no wifie material for the guys to marry, just 304s..
<b>Attention everyone!</b><br>We have all been yelling at jamie in every one of her videos to apologize to us for skinny shaming a 16 year old and making fun of an 8 year old girl with cancer. Why would we need an apology?WHY? We&#39;re not the ones who need it. those victims who faced jamie&#39;s merciless and hurtful comments should need an apology. So instead of asking for an apology for ourselves, We have to work together to force jamie to make a video apologizing to THOSE girls not US! Come on guys spread this message on jamie&#39;s video&#39;s so that she can hopefully make a video apologizing to those poor people!!!<br><b>Original by: SlayQueenEmma(Emma).</b>
What size are you “ the black hole “😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They need to get that doctor down in Texas that yells at them fat bodies. He’s just brutal…🤠
As a regular cisgender woman who is just simply lesbian, and a jew, what the hell? Im extremely embarrassed to be apart of the lgbtq community during this time, disgusting. Those people dont not even understand that hamas doesnt care about them, they would kill those &quot;pro- Palestinians&quot; with no remorse. Dumbasses 🤦‍♀️
personally with me- not rlly a hack but something that has become a pretty frequent part of my makeup routine- <br>i used to have alot of problems with my foundation and how it always looked really cakey around some parts of my face- like near my eyebrows and on the lower part of my face.<br>game changer- shave your face- the hair does not grow back any thicker then before but it does help to a lot making sure your foundation goes on flawlessly- ive had a lot of people ask me about it and i saw at the end of the video &quot;put any makeup hacks-&quot; or whatever but like this is a really good tip, and i hope it helps some people ^^
Ok ok ok ok listen I think you should not wear the sauna suit ever again that was hideous…💀💀💀
Eat a fruit and you’ll lose weight ❤
Oh that’s where my king sized bed sheets went
I use to get jack in the box once a week, same thing, love it, like 10 years straight. No weeks off. Did a diet, lost a bunch of weight. Went on a road trip and stopped to get that same meal. It was about noon. Hadn’t had it in like 7 months. Got on the road about 30 minutes later, I felt like I was gonna fall asleep. The crash was always scary. Don’t think I’ve had that meal since, maybe 9 years ago. 😊
He will finally have a father figure!!
What’s interesting is that I doubt she even believes she’s truly happy. She likely feels defeated by the thought of losing weight, through misconceptions and maybe past attempts, so she’s trying to secure validation to soothe herself.
Why are you doing this? The fat acceptance thing is bs ok. Get healthy and live a better quality and longer life. You are unhealthy. Please stop with this. If you were posting things about your journey to lose weight you would have a lot of cheerleaders. But not this look at me I’m fat and I accept myself bs. Smh
this is how crazy it is... not even 1 generation, and people who had fathers fight in the Vietnam war, already forgot that there are really evil people out in the world...
“It’s because they experienced something earlier in their life that distorted the way they meet their needs” ‼️‼️‼️ I don’t know if you’ve done a video particularly on this but what a wonderful way of putting it. Knowing our needs and meeting our needs is such an important subject for everyone, regardless of their health or weight or psychological status.
It can be hard if you are chronically overweight to lose the last ten or twenty pounds, even eating a healthy diet, but when you are that obese, it&#39;s down to poor diet overall.
I’ve been a bit too skinny my whole life and I have to credit my parents for having me grow up very healthy, I couldn’t imagine my life without being Athletic. Although tbf I acually need to gain weight and idk how people do it I get full after a reg portion meal and fast food just tastes so bad I’d rather skip a meal than eat at mcd or Wendy’s
Looking at Ashely regretfully going &#39;I&#39;m the biggest now&#39;, while Meghan can&#39;t help but go &quot;I&#39;m still fat!&quot; shows the dynamics at play. Meghan <i>has</i> to be the center of attention, and the receiver of sympathy and praise, denying it to her &#39;friend&#39;, revealing what kind of person Meghan <i>really</i> is.
Hey Kiana... did you know that EVERY SINGLE ONE of your videos AND every one of the &quot;Supersize and Superskinny&quot; videos  I watched over the last 5 days had a Wendy&#39;s commercial in it? E-V-E-R-Y S-I-N-G-L-E one. Even for a corrupt outfit like YouTube, that&#39;s pretty sad...
U guys did fight the lions , tigers and bears. And i know why even if you havent realized yet (PLEASE PAY ATTENTION)  cause to most people its the same reason that we picked the berry&#39;s as well as carried and nurtured ,struggled,in pain( and i know men know pain as much or so. As we do .....)<br><br>But did you realize we face 9 months and i promise you a porton of those 9 months wasn&#39;t at  all cherry pie for sure planning  and willingly knowing the pain it comes to ? ( Thank you for going through it by our side also i know its hard for you as well.) BUT most of you that are in the delivery room well we are having our battles ,Cant even handle the pressure .A lot of you faint or have a panic attack ect.  so when a man has the balls to take that long journey happily and especially more then once  (after knowing the experience of it ) and still love / care and sacrifices to build a family to love for the man they love and obviously feel they are worthy enough to deserve the blessing god gave us both . who did most the development ..<br><br><br>######<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23we">#We</a> know and stick to the plan in our development. 9 months in advance.

Let me remind you lot of you guys fainted cried and threw up while we were doin our part of the job but you guys are STONG...####<br><br><b>*****There is NO CRYING IN BASEBALL**</b><br><br> And thats just the beginning of so much to come (on one knows til they are there ) and no matter how old 2/13/18/25/42 you kids are they are your kids even if you were so luckey to be there when your kids them self are parents/grandparents , you realize it starts over again. The worry the hope the struggle the happiness the sadness and at one point or another we all mess up no one is perfect  we all wished we would of tryed harder been there more failed ...<br>The only thing we can do is try to make sure the people you love know the love never ends <br><br>I think that&#39;s why Men fight the lions proving his appreciation of his women, gratefulness to God our FATHER and deservingness of this LIFE he blessed upon us= Love  ...<br>Cause  believe me just cause you seen not the animals with names there are no words for we fought for you . THEY WERE THERE!!<br>We know <br>THE SAME WAY GOD IS HERE !!! THE SAME WAY GOD GAVE HIS ONLY SON FOR US ..

I always use concealer for foundation its just foundation is so thick and idk i just not my thing am a natural girl lol😅😊
you only skinny shame because you&#39;re jealous that you cant be like them❤
This is the most true thing I have seen in a long time. I followed that chronological path exactly myself. No I am the prick, conservative father!!!😂😂😂😂
I ate nothing but oatcakes for 6 weeks and lost 6 stone... I got cancer the next year and I&#39;ve put all the weight back on. So if someone tries to sell you the oatcake diet turn away from them and exclude them entirely from your life.
Okay that’s cause they’re fat and do that to there health why should be care about someone’s health or getting jobs when they’re out of shape and the job bosses could find someone more fit and capable of doing the job the best idc if your fat get a treadmill and do 5 sit ups and 5 push ups and work yourself up there
You&#39;re not bloated... You&#39;re not fat... You&#39;re the iceberg that took down the Titanic
Shock therapy is so dumb. These people buy multiple sacs of potatoes, carts full of ice cream, or whatever for themselves to eat, is it really that big of a surprise to see it all combined? On supersize vs super skinny they usually take a component of the food like sugar and show what it’s like on in a different way which maybe is a slightly better way to shock them?
21 Senators are between the ages of 70 and 80 with 50% of the Senate being over 65. 46% of the Senate Democrats are in this age range along with 54% of the Senate Republicans. 32% of the House is 65+ with 40% of the House Democrats and 23% of House Republicans. <br><br>These are scary statistics when the median age of the American citizen is only 38.8 years old. This is a problem on both sides. <br><br>Every person of power in government, especially those in the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court should be required to have a yearly physical including a mental health screening, including a yearly mental fitness/competency test if they&#39;re over the age of 65. These results must all be made public. These also should be required before a potential candidate can enter or announce their run for office, no matter the age, but especially in instances where the candidate has had some sort of illness or injury that could affect mental capacity, such as, you know, a stroke.<br><br>Laundry list of requirements we should have, I know. But our Founding Fathers didn&#39;t have to deal with these things. People didn&#39;t live long enough to experience mental deterioration in the same way that we do today.
Suger doesnt cause weight gain directly, fat does. Dairy like cheese, milk etc are superfoods designed to make babies gain weight. When you eat suger as well, you use the sugers 1st, then the other stuff like dairy get stored as fat. Too much suger while over weight means not all the suger is being used, and that causes type 2 diabetes. Reducing suger is a good idea, but stopping dairy is far more effective. Also, dont eat on a schedule, only eat when your actually hungry. Most people have no idea what actual hunger is though..
I know it’s off topic <br><br>She’s an absolute 10 but that’s not her entire personality <br>I think it’s because she was overweight and she’s still processing how stunning she is now
Thats são gross, eating fast food every day
As an American, and therefore part of a country that is notorious for overeating junk food, you really have a nerve pointing out English mistakes.
Your  not fat and you are a enough enough to be my friend
The FAT you eat = the FAT you wear. Anyone with any common sense here? Sugar does not, and in fact, can NOT make you fat. Turning carbs to fat is a process called de novo lipo genesis. This is highly ineffective in humans. Fat on the other hand however, gets effortlessly stored as body fat. Who would of thought, hey? ;)
1: didnt skinny shame someone, and post a vid next to someone dying (im going off  ppl from comeents) captoned who&#39;s healthier now?
I couldn&#39;t disagree more with the notion that you should feel good about your body when it is manifestly not attractive to consensus reality. This is just another form of delusion. I am HAPPY that I have a voice in my head that will say &quot;hey you&#39;ve put on 8 lb, better knock off the sudden fat intake!&quot; or &quot;great, now it&#39;ll take 4-5 days to fully get rid of that chick parm sandwich and 3 slices if pizza you ate when drunk because alcohol makes you do stupid things with food&quot; or &quot;get your ass to the gym now bubba!&quot;....That self-denigration is EARNED. Prancing around in a nikini when you&#39;re over 400 lb and telling yourself it&#39;s all normal is just more delusion.
When I was in the Marine Corps there were different PFT (Physical Fitness Test) standards for men and women. The three basic aspects of the PFT were the run (Men 3 miles in 18 minutes, women 1.5 miles), sit-ups (Men 80 in two minutes, women 40), upper body strength (Men 20 pull-ups, women hang onto a bar). The justification was that the men would pull the woman&#39;s weight for her.<br>Example: A man would pull up into a helicopter with his combat gear on, and then lift the woman into the helo. All she has to do is hold on. I only knew three WMs (Women Marines) who could pull their own weight.
Why is everyone fat shaming her
yeah but throw back to the time you skinny shame ppl and get angry when ppl fat shame when really they’re just reminding you of what you did 😀❤️
Although ur a doll, why say ur a size 8?  Leave that out. If ur an 8, I&#39;m a extra zero
Y’all she skinny shamed a minor she is not a good person
Ayo, I don’t mean to force anything on anyone, but we have various types of evidence for biblical events. <b>IF</b> anyone is interested, read on.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> I can’t prove God to you. It all comes down to your choice to put your trust in Jesus Christ. That’s all faith is-TRUST. Unfortunately in these recent years, science and “religion” (as we know them today) have bastardized each other and themselves. <br><br>Point is, faith is trusting in Jesus. It’s not a blind jump into what people deem “irrational.” Billy Graham said something reminiscent of that. <br><br>I have no power over you. I can only tell you, but I can’t force you. (I mean, we’re conversing online lol. I’m not at your location… yet)<br>james 4:8 “Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.”<br>hebrews 11:6 “And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.”<br><br>Check out “HolyLandSite, Cold-Case Christianity, Delafé Testimonies.” There may be more, but those are the ones I know of.<br><br>religion (Christianity) is just a relationship with God along with loving others (see james 1:27)<br><br><b>Now, onto the evidence!!</b><br><br>Here&#39;s one example: Scientists have discovered that the earth &quot;skipped&quot; a day.<br>The Bible explains how that happened. In the book of Joshua, Joshua asked the sun to stop so he and the Israelites could defeat their enemies. Then in 2 Kings, King Hezekiah learned he was dying, and pleaded to God to not let him die. God sent a prophet to king hezekiah who said hezekiah would live. Hezekiah wanted a sign, and that would be for the sun to defy the law of inertia and go back 10 degrees. NASA confirmed all this and did the math (look it up for more info).<br><br>We also found Noah’s Ark hanging out in turkey, along with anchor stones marked with crosses signifying that it’s a revered place, along with altars and many other related findings. Look it up, it’s good stuff (HolyLandSite).<br><br>more evidence for the Bible concerning cosmology and divine revelation in job 26:7, proverbs 8:27, Isaiah 40:22 (read on)<br><br>The idea that the earth was round can be dated back to 600 BC in Greece. It was more widely accepted around the 3rd century (300 BC-201 BC) The idea that the Earth floated in space was concocted circa 500 BC. Note: time was “labeled” differently back then. for example, year 3000, year 420, year 69, year 0, year 1, year 2… and so on. <br><br><br>Job 26:7: “. . .He [God] hangs the earth on nothing” The book of Job was supposedly written at 2100 BC.<br><br>Proverbs 8:27: “. . .when He drew a circle on the face of the deep. . .” Proverbs was possibly written between 970 and 686 BC<br><br>Isaiah 40:22: “it is He who sits above the circles of the earth. . .” Isaiah was written between 739 and 680 BC.<br><br><br>This one doesn’t pertain to cosmology, but it refers to divine revelation nonetheless. So you know how the Euphrates River is drying up? Well, guess what? People in the Bible are saying: “Been there, done that.” Read on to learn more.<br><br>Isaiah 11:15 “The Lord will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian sea; with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand over the Euphrates River. He will break it up into seven streams so that anyone can cross over in sandals.” <br><br>Revelation 16:12 “The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.”<br><br>How did they know about this? You tell me, my fellow Zoomerz.<br><br>Now for evidence outside the Bible<br><br>The Holy Spirit exists. I was suicidal for 9-ish months, but then I read John 3:16, and poof- the big sad went away in one night.<br><br>Also, look up John Gabbana&#39;s (boonk gang) testimony.

Don&#39;t buy junk food, don&#39;t enter a place that sells junk food, and don&#39;t live with people who eat junk food. If all you have is healthy food, it&#39;s easy to lose weight.<br>No one gets or stays fat eating lean meat and salad.<br>Not eating available junk food is hard, but if you have to go out to buy it, it is easy to stay on the diet.
I kinda remember him complaining abt having to dress a plus sized model.m back in the Project Runway days. Glad he’s changed his stripes. 🎪
last time I checked, skinny - shaming and being extremely unhealthily fat isn&#39;t body positive.
I hate videos where the creator shoves his or her face right into the camera lens. They look like disembodied talking heads. I can&#39;t focus on what they say. It&#39;s so distracting.<br><br>It sound like she tried a completely unrealistic crash diet and then got mad when it was too hard to stick with it. Losing about 5 pounds a months would be something she could stick to, but that would not give her the notoriety she wanted. Then, she discovered fat activism and they discovered her. Bingo! Her dreams of attention and admiration  are realized!
Kiana Docherty is currently my favorite youtube channel in helping me lose weight. Thanks for the great content!
It doesn’t seem like you really understand the psychology of being an overweight person or what body positivity is (though as well as some obese people you show in your videos). Your channel looks like you are just one of those fat shaming people who don’t understand that talking about health consequences is not helping at all. What helps these people is not just things like  “stop eating”, “move more” or “pull yourself together and just do it” but love and supporting environment , activities they actually like doing, a good therapist, respectful attitude, supporting family etc. Because food addiction always has something to do  with guilt, stress coping, eating up emotions because of inability to deal with them, childhood traumas and low self esteem and other “benefits” from being overweight for our brain. If I were you I’d rather stop just shaming fat people or do superiority talk on how you were overweight and point out the other real side of the problem. Why people get obese and why fat activist became what it is today.
Don&#39;t eat every 4 - 5 hours. Intermittent fasting 16:8 etc will help more than any of these tips for losing weight.
Sexy fat breast
Only person keeping you fat is yourself
Bet she&#39;d look like Wednesday fattie
Throughout history, young men of all races, religions, and creeds have been forcibly removed from their homes and sent to their deaths... and the care they&#39;ve received post war has never been adequate. I&#39;m not saying men have had it harder... but comparing the trials of men and women throughout history is moronic and until we stop this trivial polarization on all fronts we are doomed to collapse
For this kind of channels I am so grateful to be a translator .  I am from Chile and I started to watch your channel with the Tess Holiday video .  On that moment I was more into the gym and loosing weight.....but then I gained A LOT of weight.  My rock bottom was when my gynecologist told me I was pre diabetic 😱I was very scared of diabetes being a person with albinism and it&#39;s consequences to my health, especially my sight , so I decided to make changes in my life little by little  .  I was 131kg in 2019....now I am 107 kg and still trying to make some changes , but now I know I am in the right path .... hopefully ☺️.<br>Thanks Kiara and please continue to bring us information and motivation for us , the ones who REALLY WANT to change our lives and being ACTIVES, not VICTIMS
Butter in cereal sounds really gross
I can&#39;t believe the disgusting food that Americans chose to get fat on
Just saying—I don’t think many people like Gweneth Paltrow. Her company promotes a lot of very expensive products of questionable value. And she is the supreme example of a thin, wealthy, entitled blonde who has no idea how regular people live. That said, she may be anorexic. Especially if she has to “detox” every day and seems obsessed with food.  ???? <br><br>Most healthy people who like to “detox” do a dietary detox on a specific day of the week, or do it for a few days to a week at most seasonally or annually.
🎀Thé brush you used for your bronzer looks so soft and plush.🎀
The ad show clearly that women think they are some kind of prize,  lol idiots..  Plus if you have 150 lbs of fat already it will take at least 5 years of eating control / reduction to loose it.
One of the most importan things I learned in History in H.S was what Party started the KKK. From that moment on, I swore I would <b>never</b> vote Democrat. It&#39;s my #1 icebreaker when someone says they vote Democrat. #2 is &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m so sorry&quot; and then pat them on the shoulder. I&#39;ve asked a few people if it was &quot;fatal&quot; too<br>Oh, and taking a Modern European History Class where half the class was the Rise and Fall of the Societ Union, and the other half was WW2, I will never support Communism. We read about some horrible things...and all these kids think &quot;their generation will &#39;fix&#39; Communism&quot;...if being obsessed with History makes you Republican, than being a Democrat really does make you ignorant of History
Some fat titties! A compliment btw!
It’s such a weird thing to put that on a singer. Or anyone. She’s not your therapist. She writes and sings/performs songs.<br><br>Also, given that most adults ARE obese now, she USED to look like everyone else and NOW she doesn’t.
This man’s inner pain is so plainly on display, his poor self-image translated into a horrible obsession for his brand. In his mind he must’ve carried an ugly self-image that he just couldn’t shake, so instead he leaned into the whole premise of his brand. Leaned in hard, and of course the end result was gross, disturbing even.
Never not fat it seems
Because some people have sit down jobs &amp; they&#39;re lazy, never take the stairs or venture outside. Phones make you fatter than your diet. Throw your phone in the river, i garontee you&#39;ll loose 25lbs real fuckin fast.
21 pounds in 21 days is possible, with a low enough intake over that time. Half of that weight is water and glycogen, and will go straight back on after the 21 days, but you can get the reading on the scale that low. For a man, fasted weight loss is around 0.6 lbs/day, so 12.6 lbs, and can lose around 8 pounds of water if you go from fully fed to this kind of restriction as you use up your glycogen stores and your cells dump sodium, both of which cause you to shed water, plus a pound for the glycogen itself. It’s not a good plan, and the “science” is bunk, but that claim itself is plausible if very misleading with a starvation diet.
I have a feeling that big food is behind the push for fat acceptance and the &quot;600lb set-point&quot; stances. I think if we could follow those threads back to their origins we&#39;d end up in a corporate boardroom in the mix of a PR brainstorming session on how to change the narrative around the fact that their incredibly cheap, nutrient void, highly addicting chemical concoctions they gleefully label as food is causing an obesity crisis.
Fatty protests too much me thinks
BODY POSITIVE?! IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY WHEN YOU LITERALLY BODY SHAME SKINNY PEOPLE? I&#39;ve had enough of you saying your body POSITIVE when your clearly not
Justice is selective and freedom is dead, fuck the police, the judges, and the brain-dead idiots who elect them
Remember people: countries have been welcoming in infiltrators/enemies of freedom loving countries for decades and now these enemies are doing their missions unhindered...just look at the chinese and muslims in America - slowly but steadily taking over key industries...I recently went to the VA hospital and it&#39;s mostly chinese workers....hmmmmm!!!
Then don&#39;t be fat
It helped me to move out and not live with my mom anymore. I stopped binge eating and cook my own. But I couldn&#39;t lose weight so I had surgery 2 weeks ago and I have no problems sticking with the dïet that comes with it.
i maintained my weight at 48-50kg for around 1 year, but i went into another personal problem, and it caused me to stop taking care of myself and i went up to 57-58kg in just 1-2months. the problem i have is overeating. im asian and my main food is rice, so i found myself eating more and more rice. but right now i&#39;ve been trying to get back to 50kg mark, and im at 55kg now. however i find myself struggling to lose weight, because some days i eat lesser calories than my daily burnt calories, and other days i would over eat again.
Someone needs to scream at these parents and let them know that they’re killing their kids because they’re too lazy. Like they’re choosing convenience over their child’s own well being. It’s disgusting.
🤮🤮 I am waiting for disgusting monsters like that &quot;woman&quot; to go back where they came from🤮🤮<br><br>Probably hell, at least that&#39;s what she looks like😖🤮<br><br>That man gets so manipulated by his wife that he doesn&#39;t know that he can&#39;t cook at all😂😂
I would like to see a psychological study of why people decide to create the ugliest persona possible. It started in the sixties as an opposition to societal norms but has continued to the present with people becoming more and more ugly and deranged. Why?
So I was doing strength camps around that time. I weighed in just under 180lbs at 5&#39;11&quot;, had a 33&quot; waist, and A&amp;F clothes did not fit me right. My shoulders were too broad, and both my quads and calves were literally too big to get their pants on. It was absurd. Basically if you were a guy and were not legit skinny with muscles or just skinny, their clothes were not going to fit you. And by &quot;Skinny&quot; I don&#39;t mean 13%-15% BF, I mean sub 10% body fat if you had any type of athletic build. I&#39;d occasionally see regularly built guys with decent size muscles with button downs and T-shirts that were skin tight. I wondered why I never saw any of them with the shirts buttoned. When I tried some on I found out. It&#39;s because they could not button them.<br><br>As for the girls section, yeah, again, you needed to be crazy thin to fit into their clothes, and regular size hips on a size 5 was probably going to put you in a size 10 as the clothes ran so small across the board it was ludicrous. I liked the style of the clothes quite a bit, but the tailors who designed them definitely made their audience far smaller than it should have been. I mean c&#39;mon, I wore 32&quot; waist jeans/cargos in half of the brands I wore at the time, 33&quot; in the others, and I could not fit into their pants or shorts correctly? Stupid. Heh, I was a big <i>&quot;Dawson&#39;s Creek&quot;</i> fan though. That final episode. Oh those folks at the CW got me. Tearing up when I saw Jen talking to Grams, then the ending with Joey, Pacey and Dawson... <i>sniffle</i> Great, here I go again...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FVMCMxI18I&amp;t=0m02s">0:02</a> all the skinny people bar the blonde woman fourth from left are all normal skinny. Not super skinny.
Never be a stay at home father for a CEO mother!  90% divorces are instigated by &quot;educated&quot; women. You end up at 50 with no career and no access to your own children. Father CEOs make money for a family. Mother CEOs make money for her &amp; the kids. There are few exceptions
Serena is a big ugly bitch and shes also very annoying and rude idgaf if she is good at throwing balls. Ashley is a fatass who has no talent at all. can a fat man become famous/rich by pretending to be a model? Hell naw
That singer chick is probably on something like Prednisone, it’s a steroid, often given for Lupus to decrease inflammation. It can cause terrible weight gain.
⚠️STOP SCROLLING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE⚠️<br><br><br>At this point, we know Jamie reads the comment because these videos CANT be serious. So instead of fat jokes and comments, let’s fill her comment with this message so she knows that we know she is trolling us. <br><br><br><br>Jamie if you are reading this, we demand an apology for you skinny shaming that 16 year old girl, blaming your older sister for being fat, lip syncing the n-word, ect., which you know what they are. Repost this on Jamie’s videos to get the message out!!
the way your fat jiggled 😂
I love freedom too, sadly companies like Google want to strip our freedoms over time.
bro she can’t even fit in the biggest size
Size matters thats why you dont get importance
WOMAN not everything has to be plus sized this trend isnt even about being skinny its probably the most plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus sized friendly trend
Supersize v superskinny was the best program ever it showed the 2 extreme ends of the spectrum. Often the superskinny actually had a bigger eating disorder than the supersize. still these shows are good motivation for weight loss
R. R you r.  Fat just like me and i. Am. A. Kid
Awkwardly wave ur arms around if being fat is ur whole personality<br><br>Her:
When I was a stay-at-home mom for a year, I got the most ugly comments, people thinking I was lazy and should start working. Now I&#39;m working only 1or 2 days and people stopped being like that, why does that one/two days matter though? Isn&#39;t feminism also about giving women the choice to do what they want?
This makes no sense??? She’s acting like a plus size person can’t eat good and healthy food(vegetables)
As a fat person in the process of creating a better lifestyle, thank you for saying that “fat people don’t like being fat.” Because that is so true. I use to feel bad for saying that because I didn’t wanna seem like I didn’t love myself. But when you think about it it’s like, “well you don’t. Cause you’re not working on being healthier. You’re just gaining more weight.” I’ve always felt that way of not liking being fat. &amp; I’ve never heard other people say that.
Honestly think they did her more harm than good. Only thing that benefited her change was the exposure and accountability. Them purposely sneak feeding her ham was horrible.  <br><br>I&#39;m glad you brought attention to many of the other factors that could explain a person&#39;s food &quot;addiction&quot;, but you didn&#39;t discuss the way those foods act on her brain. Carbs give us a rush, the fats make it last longer, so even eating this a few times a week would make you crave it so you could feel that good again. She has years of memories of this food combo being safe, delicious, and making her feel good - that is something that will take a long time of continuous effort to counteract.
Size dosent matter but age does
Didn&#39;t know three years later bro would start losing weight and now is going to live his life to the fullest
she didnt..didn&#39;t... grind the cheese. the tomatoes look like they were cut too thick and the sauce wasn&#39;t put on gently... mam as you would say &quot;the audacity&quot; of making such a sad sandwich. 3/10
Jamie ur not fat<br><br><br><br><br>yeah u are but oh well. That 16 year old deserves an apology NOW. SKINNY SHAMING IS THE SAME THING AS FAT SHAMING SO GO APOLOGIZE OR YOULL REGRET IT 😊😊😊🕺🕺💃💃💃
I&#39;m 14 years old and trying to loose weight so I can fit into some clothes I have and I&#39;m trying to achieve a slimmer body for the asthetic. I&#39;m 9 stone and 12 lbs. I really appreciate you and this channel, it&#39;s helped a lot.
Lower weights and more reps are better. Long lean muscles look nicer. So continue doing what you’re doing.
This show was usually aired in January, like all the other weight loss shows (fat families, biggest loser etc) to take advantage of people and their new year resolutions.<br>If you need to wait for a certain date to make a change guys, you won&#39;t make that change. Join a gym in November. Don&#39;t live to excess in December. By the time January comes, it&#39;ll be easy to just carry on. And you will carry on.
To eat a salad predominate diet , you have to use an oil , grapeseed , olive , peanut etc., etc., and mixed with spices and or different vinegars . Using mayonnaise , sour cream , etc., etc., based dressings is redundant . As well pure olive oil as an example is a healthy choice because of its high polyunsaturated fat content, it is also resistant to oxidation at high temperatures, making it a good choice for baking as well as cooking.
As a doctor I all I can say is my experience is that people often lack the education necessary to identify the reasons why they don’t succeed. They also are deeply sad or frustrated most of the time, which needs addressing first. Plus, when 40% of chronic obesity is due to undiagnosed ADHD, they need to be screened for this and treated if appropriate because they aren’t going to lose any weight of their brain drives them to eat all the time.
“No I look fat”🤣🤣🤣🤣
One of the most importan things I learned in History in H.S was what Party started the KKK. From that moment on, I swore I would <b>never</b> vote Democrat.

If someone fat says 10/10 would recommend I wouldn&#39;t recommend since she clearly would eat anything 😬
They already took a founding father and race switched them. Its called &#39;Hamilton&#39;
I absolutely love how you speak out about these issues. Yes some people really struggle with losing weight and being healthy due to food addiction etc which is really sad for people struggling with this but this “body positivity” cult is just so toxic and unhealthy. <br>People should be proud of themselves for being healthier even if they’re not able to be “skinny” not glorifying being unhealthy and making other people feel like if they tried to be healthy they would be attacked and made to look like the bad guys. <br>I’m glad people are starting to see through this because it’s sooooooo damaging and scary to think that people can be bullied into something like this by these so called “body positivity” influencers.
HERE IS A CLIP SOMEONE POSTED ABOUT JAMIE AND HER SISTER W CANCER<br><br><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/18DYu0Fl3Ug?feature=share">https://youtube.com/shorts/18DYu0Fl3Ug?feature=share</a><br><br>btw sorry couldnt find a skinny shaming one!
congrats girl just subbed love your style!!! i will be watching for sure :) pls check out my channel i am just starting plus size fashion thank you so much
No matter what I do can&#39;t lose weight. I don&#39;t know if it is the medications I&#39;m taking or the conditions I developed while having fibromyalgia. Always thinking about good choices for food, preparing meals from scratch and keeping myself active.
Is he wrong, they breed boys not men under the umbrella of toxic masculinity
Would LOVE to see you do an episode on the Tumblr weight loss culture which was mainly blogs and blogs of proa**  that myself and so many others fell into during the 2009-2012 era
Fat shaming saves lives.
Freedom seeds
Brussels sprouts; why would she start off with the most disgusting vegetable to eat… She should’ve eaten a lightly, steamed carrot, or some peas
selenators are the most disgusting fandom who spread false rumors due to jealousy and it&#39;s no surprise the girl they do all this for is a real mean fake girl underneath. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23projection">#projection</a><br><br>Justin knows that chick was using him just like she did other musician exes. <br>Even if he never got with Hailey after dumping his ex, he would never go back to that. He got wise.
Don&#39;t you het tired of going after this People you might lose some weight.
What does idiot and know that God is often referred to as father.  My father, who’s thout in heaven.<br>I am a father and the last time I checked I do have a penis. Therefore God has a penis.
Fat people may have eaten up A and F (no pun intended) but their business model is used widely around the world to attract hip, attractive young people still to this day and no you won&#39;t find any plus size sections there.
I have better looking and fabulous quality bushes from the 99 cents store!! The silver highlights was just so stupid, ugly, &amp; way to overpriced!
This is the most horrifying and disgusting thing I have ever seen in my life. Every single one of them should be given an education in how to eat properly because it&#39;s quite obvious that they&#39;ve done nothing but consume copious amounts of junk food their entire lives.
Kiana! Video suggestion: how intuitive eating doesn&#39;t work for obese people because their satiety mechanism is and food intuition mechanisms are shot and the evidence is plain for everyone to see. That awful fat positivity song talking about listening to their bodies is a joke.
Go girl go.....more than ever we need to get in shape and loose weight in these Covid times !!!!! x
Omds what the actual if I was that fat I would at least do something about it bc if my stomach was as saggy and fat! Wouldn’t that be a wake up call? Obviously not for you bc your are the same and why are you skinny shamming people when you are fat
One of her best videos. Plus I learned a lot. Thank you Tati for your honesty.
i hate to tell you but uhm there’s a weight limit and your over it
If obesity was good, wild animals would be obese.<br>Have you ever seen a fat lion?
Mothers and fathers his to blame kid in the carribean is much healthier the parents should not have kids because they never learn anything in Life good luck
Because some people have sit down jobs &amp; they&#39;re lazy, never take the stairs or venture outside. Phones make you fatter than your diet. Throw your phone in the river, i garontee you&#39;ll loose 25lbs real fuckin fast.
My biggest motivation for losing weight was actually a Halloween costume! I didn&#39;t meet my goal weight, but I did convert a lot of body fat into muscle of equal weight.
Normalized skinny people and fat people not you
Fat dude here. So brave of you. I was overweight most of my life and made a change a few years ago due to a health care. I began weight training constantly (3 weeks of 5 - 6 days/week then 1 week off) and almost can eat anything I want (2 buffets this week and just had chips now). It would be nice if body positivity was focused more about being comfortable in your body if you make some effort towards health.
Here in Canada, that whole apartment is the size of my weight room, still gotta bedroom, living room, kitchen, laundry room, bathroom.... that kitchen is the size of the bathroom. $300 a month.
Watching this at 35 weeks and just ugly crying through this whole recollection. I just admire your relationship with your husband so much!
I&#39;ve never been overweight, or underweight, but my relationship with food is/was kinda like you said. Eating stuff out of habit, to scratch a itch, and it felt not like a choice. In the process of changing that.
I am sure that the BP movement was more about disfigurement, differences and disabilities when it first came about. The obese co opted it and then complain and cut people out. Mental
As a skinny person who’s been called “anorexic,twig,skin and bones,branch etc body shaming skinny people rlly does hurt just as much
I love elf! I been using elf since way back. I like it because I have sensitive skin and they&#39;re products  don&#39;t break me out or irritate. Plus its affordable. I&#39;m obsessed 😍  I like they&#39;re illuminating pallet!
Honey you can’t say that you are body positive when you skinny shame.
WE DEMAND AN APOLOGY! SKINNY SHAMING A 16 YEAR OLD IS NOT OK!

Recovery from being skinny?
You are beautiful the way you are I know you think your fat but you are not you are perfect
Hope lady loses the weight glad she trying
Tata can I just say I’m so happy that you and James worked things out. You speak of him with such love and when you two are on camera and or share the two of you on IG you can see the love you have for each over. Remember God is great and he will never forsake you. Much love all the way from Arizona ❤<br><br>PS. Went to Dallas about 6 weeks ago I was so hoping I would run into you just by miracle. I obviously didn’t but dear I say it was way hotter there than Arizona due to the humidity you all have. Plus it didn’t hep that we were staying at the Gaylord resort and the water is right there. 😂
Putting aside the issue of gender, why is it wrong to put &quot;parent&quot; instead of &quot;mom&quot;? Mothers are parents and have been long before we starting talking about gender. Plus the paper didn&#39;t say &quot;What does your kid call you?&quot; But what the relationship is... Well she is the parent. Not legal gurdian, not grand parent... But parent. Why focus on what the kid calls her?
Don’t bestie me after you skinny shamed and said “look who’s healthier now “ to you own sister who had cancer? Your done.
1 cookie will NEVER make anyone fat. A conveyor belt of anything will.
My why is literally because I want to be able to wear cute clothes that literally have always been out of my reach due to my weight. I lost 40 lbs last year. Gained 15 back and now I&#39;m back to a 35lb overall weight loss. I&#39;m still fighting and doing my best to lose.
try and lose weight
She&#39;s a horrible person I hate her sm she has shamed sm ppl in many different ways not only cancer shaming and skinny shaming she also said the n word
They are the same thing being skinny is horrible you eat and eat and eat and nothing changes every one tells you that you need to eat I&#39;m not saying being fat is not as bad but they are the same thing
At 12 years old I was 235 pounds and always complained to my mom that it was her fault and it was her doing that made me fat. So last December I started, I’ve lost 55 pounds and am now skinny with people complementing me and telling me they are inspired by me. Anything is possible
Congratulations on your WSJ cover!! You look fabulous and yes, I agree...it should be the norm for clothes to fit every size! 🙌<br>I would LOVE a copy of that magazine with you on the cover!!! 😍💕
I can’t believe you body shame people for being skinny
There&#39;s nothing positive about morbid obesity. Absolutely nothing.
You should definitely apologize for being yourself especially If you are like that and are so fat you start to generate your own gravitational feild
We DEMAND an apology, Jamie skinny shaming a 16 year old Is not okay!
Listen, I know this isn&#39;t about looks, its about health, but chubby Kiana was SO CUUUTE! Of course gorgeous now too, but omg I love that picture 🥹
Body positivity should also include more for people with IBS and PCOS ( beyond weight gain! ) we struggle with acne, bloating, and worse. We could be normalizing that but nah we’d rather normalize unhealthy eating I guess
I have a super slow and sluggish metabolism due to having an Atomic cocktail  (Radioactive Iodine) when I was 24 and being on Thyroxine for so many years, I&#39;m now 68 and gain weight incredibly quickly, I&#39;ve learned to have a three-day fast, drinking water only, about 3 times a month, most often I eat one to two high protein meal a day, no carbs, and once a week I have a high good fat extra large salad, with either olive oil, avocado oil, and sheep&#39;s milk cheese with braggs vinegar, that is my only raw veggies for the week, and I may have cooked non starchy vegetables once a week as well, other than that I only eat beef,  un - farmed salmon steaks, and pasture raised eggs, decaf coffee with  heavy cream and sweetened with burch xylitol, also some frozen wild blueberries a couple times a week... This has been a very effective approach for a steady and slow weight loss for me, I also love mall walking and climbing up very high hills  4 times a week, I&#39;ve learned as well that at my age a one to two hour nap especially after being active is necessary daily...It&#39;s been such a startling realization to me to learn how truly little food I need to  thrive in life.
I lost roughly 150lbs thru IF and a mostly carnivore diet. I believe in the carnivore diet, but I know that I could have lost the weight via other means. If you&#39;re determined, most diets can help you lose weight. I&#39;m just somebody who loves eating meat, and on the carnivore diet you can eat pretty much as much as you want. If you do try the carnivore diet, please use supplements if you&#39;re not eating head to tail of the animal, you&#39;ll need them.
as someone who conciders herself a BEAUTIFULL pluz size women, i loved listening to this, and not only that, but relating and noticing that it happens to everyone. and i love what you guys do to the industry and what you represent
Beta&#39;s??? Or clever alpha&#39;s??? They probably doing like my father did just cut his sack and were an ice patch after going to his &quot;appointment&quot; <br><br>Pretty funny how easy it was for him to get away with it like all he had to say was yea he was gonna do it then did his trick and still had 3 more kids 🤣😂🤣😂 &quot;must be a miracle&quot; 😂🤣😂🤣
I&#39;m a fat, middle-aged, upper middle-class, conservative, happily married white woman. Who am I supposed to blame my obesity on? These people are nuts.
Girl u skinny shamed people but you can’t even talk like you act like you haven’t seen yourself in a mirror
There are kettle and fire bone broths that are like 200 calories. Also she didn&#39;t say the amount of broth, also she said soup, there&#39;s a million types of soup? Intermittent fasting increases your lifespan and reduces the risk of certain cancers. Idk fat activists are weird. Go read books I guess? Knowledge really slims you down, I promise.
If I were her sister, I&#39;d lock her in a room and give her a strict as all hell diet until she loses weight. Once she&#39;s able to walk on her own, I&#39;d leave. That&#39;s it. She&#39;s an adult. She can take care of herself after that. I would literally be so done with her so quickly
get this in your head YOU ARE NOT A ‘BODY POSITIVE BFF’ IF YOU SKINNY SHAME PEOPLE AND USE THE FACT YOUR OVERWEIGHT AS YOUR WHOLE PERSONALITY!!
For those that don’t know here’s what she did she skinny shamed a sixteen yr old that had an eating disorder she made a video with her twin who had cancer for the second time and titled it “ who’s healthier now?” She also blamed her sister with a drug addiction for making her fat she doesn’t deserve her sisters so stop defending her
Girl is more thick when she looks at the mcdonald&#39;s happy meal it immediately turns sad 💀
🎀Thé brush you used for your bronzer looks so soft and plush.🎀
My husband is not fat. But he gets grumpy when he is hungry. In the evenings he allways claims he did not eat anything the whole day.<br>But I know for sure that he ate a lot.<br>I think there is this kind of dementia in thin people, too. <br>Especially in people who cook their own meals. Because they are very often in the kitchen and eat things. <br>I do not enter the kitchen if I do not have to.<br>In my oppinion it is easier to stay slim and fit if you are a bad person, who doesn never cook healthy food. Just search something to eat when you are really hungry and only eat that one thing you really want to eat at that moment. <br>When I cook, I allways eat the whole fridge empty while I wait for the water to boil, or the cheese to melt or whatever. Then I am not even hungry anymore, but I do not want to waste my good meal.
ok oversized jellybean- 💀
It can be hard if you are chronically overweight to lose the last ten or twenty pounds, even eating a healthy diet, but when you are that obese, it&#39;s down to poor diet overall.
Body Positive = Big Fat Slobs 🤢
It&#39;s you&#39;re weight
Agreed! The food environement is disgusting right now and so many lies are accepted in the name of marketing its just gross
Hope lady loses the weight glad she trying
if they have money to eat that much they probably would have money to import some bananas, apples, cabbages or whatever cheap fruits and vegetables as well. Not saying they got treated poorly, but a lot of this also has to do with low education.<br><br>Btw 25% protein, 75% fat is not such a bad ratio for meat or meat products. People just shouldn&#39;t glut on foods like that
This video is already aging poorly. Your channel also has nothing to do with this topic so you clearly were just trying to make money off the hysteria/hate campaign like every other creator. Totally transparent and gross, you should be ashamed.
ohhh! you mean the sister you skinny shamed?
Fat people need to be healthier. Being fat is bad. End of story
OMG yes it was totally my dream to go to fat camp as a child as well! I wasn&#39;t even particularly fat, just demonstrably not the skinny child my parents wanted me to be.
I actually liked all of them.  Although I think women will thick hips and thighs like me can&#39;t carry off this look.
I’m so tired of being skinny. I feel like I’m always tired and in a bad mood. I never get any work done, due to the fact that when I come home from school I’m just too tired and I fall asleep until dinner. I’m even too tired to eat dinner. I’ve lost all of my friends because I’m too tired to do anything. I’m failing school because of it. <br>I have low blood sugar so my hands are always shaky and my vision goes black very easily.<br>I don’t eat breakfast or lunch, just dinner. Because I don’t have an appetite for breakfast and lunch. Even when I’m hungry, I stay hungry because I like the feeling of my stomach growling. Sometimes I feel like throwing up. <br>Welcome to my life. Where I just lie in bed all day, depressed, sad and lonely.<br>That’s how fun being really skinny is.
Not in the USA, but I was on one of those &quot;weight loss camp&quot; in Poland as a kid and it was pretty cool. 2 times a day we had to exercise, but it was done in funny way like zumba or games where you have to run a lot. We were taught about choosing our food, what is healthy and what is not. But other than that it was a really nice experience with movie nights, street games, sightseeing. After 2 weeks Ive lost 2,5kg which was really cool. I got a book with different healthy recipes and a whole chapter made for parents to read so they can educate themselves too :)
Ofc someone will kiss after u made fun of your dying sis that have cancer and being mean for skinny people💀
One God bless you you&#39;re so beautiful that you&#39;re made in the image of the Angels oh God angels are watching over you we like your websites and we like your talk about clothing in your size it shouldn&#39;t matter God bless you for going on YouTube I wouldn&#39;t want to go on I want you to know about my weight so you got a good sense of ability God bless you will pray for you and two thumbs up and we&#39;re joining your websites in the midwest Wisconsin if you&#39;re ever in Wisconsin don&#39;t hesitate to stop by our farms communities and you can sample free cheese and crackers homemade cheese from Wisconsin we&#39;re praying for you everyday you&#39;re on your prayer list Wisconsin and what we&#39;re learning disability has respect❤
&quot;body positive bestie&quot; <br>you skinny shamed a 16 yr old girl. we demand a fucking apology.
It’s just crazy that  it took a fat comment for people to be outraged at the brand. Not the creepy behaviour, not the racism or the way they were targeted teens. Or how they treated the workers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
People don&#39;t like you Jamie.  U need to apologize to us for what you have done.  You said some fked up sht and it horrible.  We all know you aren&#39;t sorry. You went up to your SISTER that had cancer and then said who is healthier now and you skinny shamed multiple people. COPY THIS AND KEEP SPAMMING IT
You should do a video on the British show fat families! It’s along the lines of secret eaters and supersize vs super skinny
Thank goodness I&#39;m one of those few people who can taste aspartame and sucralose. Anything with that in it tastes disgusting to me. Also, I think you might have missed something. Aspartame has been shown (I think) to retain the body&#39;s water. Many people who drink diet Coke are overweight. Of course, that could be diet related as well. Also, I haven&#39;t touched Coke since they told me I should be &quot;less white.&quot; After they went woke a year or two ago, I won&#39;t touch any of their products. I absolutely despise Pepsi (think it tastes gross), but if it&#39;s a choice between Coke and Pepsi, I&#39;m drinking Pepsi.
Wait did she say fat camp💀
I have a feeling that big food is behind the push for fat acceptance and the &quot;600lb set-point&quot; stances. I think if we could follow those threads back to their origins we&#39;d end up in a corporate boardroom in the mix of a PR brainstorming session on how to change the narrative around the fact that their incredibly cheap, nutrient void, highly addicting chemical concoctions they gleefully label as food is causing an obesity crisis.
How about all those fat old people… Oh yeah, there aren’t any.
Lose weight then 👍, problem solved
Mustard greens help you lose stomach fat and helps your Core !
Personally i think that those morbidly obese &quot;models&quot; are ugly and entitled af
Thank you so much for your excellent content! I&#39;m trying to figure out how long the word weight loss journey has been used. It seems like I&#39;ve only heard of it recently. I much prefer the word that you used in the video story. to me a journey implies an ending. Yes, Once you get down to your goal weight, then I guess your weight loss journey has ended. But story seems to encompass that my healthy eating plan is something that needs to  continue for the rest of my life , and I&#39;ll have to continue to watch for regain.
I might need an education on what the word &#39;liberal&#39; means in America... The international definition is that people have the right to do what they want, when they want, with who they want, as long as it doesn&#39;t infringe on others having the same right. It&#39;s literally freedom. Why would you be against that?

girl, no one calls you “your favorite body positive bestie” and how can you be body positive when you skinny shame 😭 😭
&#39;&#39;hey fatty&#39;&#39; no shot, i spilled my coffee laughing 😂😂
it&#39;s the same thing for people who are underweight anorexic too. Many of them will say &quot;I&#39;m healthy&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s a lifestyle&quot;, or even &quot;I&#39;m not underweight&quot;-- or worse &quot;I&#39;m fat!&quot; They don&#39;t believe they&#39;re withering away. They believe they&#39;re the most obese person in the room. Eating disorders are all like that, based in self-deception and delusion. It&#39;s also just like a food addiction, only on the opposite end of the spectrum. Instead of lying to others that they&#39;re on a diet, anorexic nervosa patients will lie that they did eat, and they&#39;ll lie to you, me, their parents, their doctors, everyone. The real question is... how does one even talk to someone who is delusional (whether they&#39;re deluded into not believing their overweight or underweight)? How does one get them to see that they&#39;re severely underweight, that they need help, or that they can die at any moment because of it? I don&#39;t know the answer. All I know is that it&#39;s sad. For many addicts that recover, sometimes it&#39;s not even a matter of hitting &quot;rock bottom&quot;. They say that addicts will change when they want to change.  So how can we even begin to help anorexic or obese people see their unhealthiness? Delusions are just that-- no amount of data or proof will undo a delusion. The person themself will have to be the one to overcome it. I don&#39;t know one person on this planet that knows how to hurry up that &quot;overcome delusion&quot; process, though, in order to save lives.
Ain&#39;t nobody wanna be a bestie with a skinny shamer
I don’t understand the ugly comments. If you don’t like her just don’t watch her. Continuing to be ugly is straight up being a bully.
Honest question...what are protein bars for? Or shakes? Or powders?Are they snacks or meals? Do you only eat them if you go to the gym. I know you&#39;re supposed to eat protein to lose weight but honestly, I have no idea what that means. I just keep it under a certain amount of calories
Just wondering, where are any men in Taylah&#39;s life? She has children - where are the fathers? How are they pulling their weight?
The parents are over weight
I wish my parents knew how bad and unhealthy fast food was before they ended up obese
This is the definition of disgusting
Jamie’s a horrible person her sister has cancer and she did a video it’s now deleted but you can still find it on YouTube she said who’s healthier now? To her sister that litterally has CANCER and she skinny shamed a 16 year old girl
Therapy is the best way to help with weight loss when it comes to adults and children; at least when the weight comes from something like an Eating Disorder or lack of Motivation. <br>Obesity disorder is usually a snake that eats itself; it’s a cycle that keeps getting compacted as everyone calls them disgusting things. <br>It can’t be fixed in a 4-12 week camp. That’s why they do these disgusting “quick fixes” for children; they show immediate short term results but many will NEVER reach their long term goals because none of these kids are really getting their true problems addressed.
I normally stick to certain times when I eat. My body will routinely tell me that I&#39;m hungry at those times. <br>I think my only issue is not knowing when I&#39;m full. Oftentimes, I accidently eat too much, and then the fullness sets in. I end up feeling bloated because I&#39;ve eaten too much. This becomes much harder when the food is super tasty, or the portions are self served.😅 I always feel the need to make sure my plate is clear. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve unconsciously conditioned myself to do. I was always taught to finish what&#39;s on my plate.<br>I&#39;m at a healthy weight, but bloating is what I struggle with a lot because of my appetite.
Can&#39;t cancel someone who has a growing audience of 1.4 billion people that aren&#39;t woke.<br>Plus they are busy scamming old people on what grounds would they even cancel him.
girl , you first thought we were besties, now we gonna kiss like, that&#39;s what your king sized pillow is for
I mean Joan Rivers is a comedian, so her jokes were just that jokes<br><br>How the fashion media industry dealt with it was incredibly disgusting
Honestly there are not so fat people in britain at all by a long shot. I never saw a really huge obese person in california but i saw really enormous people and i had never in my life seen such peopke in the uk. There are some obese peopke and some fat people for sure but i never saw anything like what i saw in california it was amazing and mind blowing ...i had to try not to stare but my eyes would just be drawn and my jaw would just drop completely because i had never seen anything like it. And i believe california isnt as bad as other usa
You are beautiful the way you are I know you think your fat but you are not you are perfect
When you relize your skinnier then jaimie: I guess I&#39;m not that fat after all
God forbid children are gonna have fun when they are trying to lose weight
It&#39;s really ironic that fat acceptance folks get up in arms and want to censor medical terms like &quot;obesity,&quot; but are perfectly fine with calling people &quot;infinifat&quot; and &quot;death fat&quot; which are not medical terms and sound so much more insulting than the medical terminology. Just goes to show how batshit insane this movement is.
This is an excellent chat. I&#39;ve been watching this podcast for some time now, but none of the other episodes (no shade) have hit me like this one. I&#39;m going through my own path of forgiveness and I didn&#39;t have the true connection between forgiveness and freedom but now it&#39;s so apparent. I&#39;m excited to catapult myself into this forgiveness so I, too, can rid myself of the shackles of non-forgiveness.
WHAT<br><br>Bullied at a FAT CAMP for being &quot;fat&quot;<br><br>That makes no sense?<br><br>Also sorry for all the hate you get, keep being you ❤️
Encouraging people to be obese, and encouraging assisted suicide, are both the same thing.  Encouraging people to end everything to end pain instead of addressing that mental pain.
I am totally with you on this!  Do not eat the Pizza and I do not!  Now I do not but earlier in my life i did!  I am 59 years old now and I am now weigh 159.  When I was in my twenties, I used to weigh about 230.  I have been in the proper BMI for my last 20 years.  I feel just like you do!  I feel even now that I am a fat person or at least I have it in me to be a fat person and I have to constantly be vigilant to watch what I eat.  I have learned to watch my caloric intake verses my steps daily and it seems to work for me......Just wished I could quick smoking!  LOL....We all have our vices!
i love how fat ppl eat healthy on video but eat like 12 cheeseburgers in the bathroom. lol
Fat camp? Money well spent
You can never go wrong with the single string metal intro into thick cords.
I was so excited for this drop but it looks so bad over my acne and it made my skin look so dry and gross
Not in the USA, but I was on one of those &quot;weight loss camp&quot; in Poland as a kid and it was pretty cool. 2 times a day we had to exercise, but it was done in funny way like zumba or games where you have to run a lot.

After 2 weeks Ive lost 2,5kg which was really cool. I got a book with different healthy recipes and a whole chapter made for parents to read so they can educate themselves too :)
I have just binge watched heaps of your videos! I am learning so much and really loving the advice and science behind why we do what we do. I am very guilty of binge eating and have struggled with my weight/body image my whole life. I didn&#39;t even know it was considered a disorder! Thank you so much for making these videos. ❤️
Why is she this fat I’m worried for her
I LOve Selena and I Love Hailey. They both seem so sweet and kind women and other women shouldnt keep saying hurtful stuff towards hailey because she did nothing wrong to yall same for selena. And what if all she talks about is justin? Hmmm they are married hellooo. 🙄 yall are so disgusting.
Ive been sick since i was thin at age 16. Now im fat and sick. Drs just focus on the fat part. If i lose weight, my sickness will be taken seriously
Former binge eater myself, I beat this disease almost a decade ago and became a competitive cyclist. I came across your channel by accident a few days ago, and, Kiana, I can’t stop watching! Holy shit I had no idea I needed this type of content! I had no clue mukbang or fat activism even existed to this extent. I’m well aware of all the science you’re highlighting throughout your videos, but the delivery is so entertaining, I watched almost every video. Keep it up 👏
DAAMNNN!!! She&#39;s old looking! I&#39;m 45 and don&#39;t look like that. She looks at LEAST 10 years older than she is, before and after weight.
Me and my friend are weightlifters. His a powerlifter, I’m an Olympic lifter. One day in uni we had an epic cheat day (by our standards) we had subway for lunch, Pizza Hut for dinner, a tub of Ben and jerrys each, and other snacks etc. by the end we had consumed over 6000 cals and we felt so disgusting we have never done it again, it wasn’t even satisfying it was just gross after a while. So for me I cannot fathom how people live like that on the day to day, and this is from someone who eats 3000 cals just to maintain weight
Sooooo, “Midsized people are DESPERATE TO BE OPPRESSED”???  So that means for insane leftists, BEING OPPRESSED is not only desirable but people are DESPERATE for it. <br><br>So seek to be oppressed so you can be cool, got it. 😎
Ashley looks like she has lost a lot of weight
I’m a canadian, but I moved to America when I was still a baby, that being before my mother who took me passed away in December of 2008. And my dad was arrested for a reason that’s unknown to me, and I’m not sure when he’s coming back. So then I had to move in with my grandparents who live a gross American lifestyle, and they fed me good foods, I literally liked healthy food that most kids hated, but then as I got older, they kept feeding me greasy fast food because they couldn’t be bothered to go shopping. This lead me to have a junk food addiction, I still have it, and I’m 15 now. But I am going vegan because I hate my body, and bc of animals, but yeah. They still keep buying me fast food and they keep saying that shit like chocolate is good for me. It makes me sick watching other parents do that same exact shit to kids far younger than me.
WHERE DO I FIND THAT SHE SKINNY SHAMES AND MAKES GUN OF HER SISTER BC OF CANCER AND HER SAYING THE N WORD?????
tf is fat camp
Ik I’m « ugly » but once your around 30 people’s opinion shifts from your looks to your accomplishments
Such a beautiful thing adding all shapes and sizes. Awesome!!!. Great stuff!. 👍
U look beautiful no matter what size
Everyone let&#39;s just block Jamie if she wants to skinny shame and ask who is healthier when her sister who has cancer can&#39;t help it
Yes! I love mini makeup too, like Nars orgasm blush. If only they had all the blushes in mini size. I get everything mini when travelling and in your purse for quick touch ups❤
Can fat people just share their secrets to skinny people, then there would be only one group to shame🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Don&#39;t buy junk food, don&#39;t enter a place that sells junk food, and don&#39;t live with people who eat junk food. If all you have is healthy food, it&#39;s easy to lose weight.<br>No one gets or stays fat eating lean meat and salad.<br>Not eating available junk food is hard, but if you have to go out to buy it, it is easy to stay on the diet.
Damn you are very desperate for a date. Well first you need to apologize for skinny shaming a 16 year old girl
The % of obese people in the UK and the US is not reflective of the % of extreme obesity cases. Those aren&#39;t mid 60% those are &gt;0.1% of cases.
It’s just crazy that  it took a fat comment for people to be outraged at the brand. Not the creepy behaviour, not the racism or the way they were targeted teens. Or how they treated the workers
Intentional Weight Loss Doesn&#39;t work? I&#39;m an even 6 in height. <br>At 18 I was a literal skeleton with skin and weighed 165lbs, at 30 I was 242lbs and quite fat. <br>Now at 32 I am 171lbs simply by cutting excess food and walking instead of taking the car or bus. <br>These people have no accountability and blame everything on society instead of introspecting.
This is why I prefer the term &quot;calorie excess&quot; to &quot;overeating&quot; because it&#39;s a clearer term.  You can consume too many calories and not feel full and therefore not feel you are overeating.
What an attention whore. She was never trying to lose weight. She knew filming herself pigging out would get views. Thats it. She doesn’t care.
Omg . This is stupid .all ppl are fat including myself are due to not eating healthy . Lil or no exercise.
It might be more useful to discuss the hormonal and bilogical components of weight gain. The focus on obesity, is a focus on the aesthetic. If health is what you care about, discuss health. There is a subtle but important distinction. As a person who was fat and lost weight... people gave no fucks about my health when i was fat and when i lost weight. I simple became easier on the eyes and that&#39;s all that mattered. Also, your thumbnails of excessively obese people can read as dehumanization and a caricature of a community you are trying to help. Just think maybe about if yourtarget audience, leaves your channel feeling shamed or empowered. (not to say they don&#39;t) great well researched content! I&#39;d love to even see some content about insulin resistance, pcos, etc etc etc since many of those factors affect &quot;obesity&quot;. The other part of this is.... i recommend some class analysis, race analysis even. Making obesity an individual and behavioral issue... screams that perhaps, you could be missing something important.
Your at fat camp?? Why would people call you fat if there fat??🤔
i’m 12, and 188 lbs (last time I was weighed) and i’m 5’4. i’m gonna start trying to lose weight by learning different types of dances like jumpstyle (I think it looks super fun and I love the music the people dance to) i’m also gonna try to eat less. I’ve honestly have been trying to lose weight for a while but I would lose then gain but i’m trying! :3
Fat people need to be healthier. Being fat is bad. End of story
This is disgusting child abuse. If they don&#39;t fix their shit their children should be taken away.
Jamie skinny shaming;<br>https://youtu.be/043GIH1tdWY<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Eaj_SJyqJQ">https://youtu.be/7Eaj_SJyqJQ</a><br><br>Jamie lip syncing the n word<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kiR1E1yXYw4">https://youtube.com/shorts/kiR1E1yXYw4</a><br><br>Jamie being ableist<br>https://youtube.com/shorts/kdCaDgt0X8E<br><br>There you go.
What’s interesting is that I doubt she even believes she’s truly happy. She likely feels defeated by the thought of losing weight, through misconceptions and maybe past attempts, so she’s trying to secure validation to soothe herself.
You literally are trying to make ur self fell better after skinny shamming a 16 yr old. High schoolers already have enough on their plate. They don&#39;t need a rando on the internet causing more bulling to them. <br><br>If you think bringing others down is going to help ur cause it&#39;s not. If you think it&#39;s ok to shame another person&#39;s body, why do u think it&#39;s any different from people commenting on urs?
I was obese , but nowhere even close to these people, but I was conscious that I needed to lose weight at the age of 58.<br>My problem was binge eating late at night.<br>I went and had a blood test and thankfully no problems.<br>I went on to the carnivore diet as did my wife and it&#39;s been amazing.<br>See have both had steady weight loss, better sleep and so much energy.<br>We swim for 1 hour every day and feel as if we were in our 20&#39;s.<br>Our mantra is &quot;Nothing tastes as good as thin feels&quot;
Hello! Found this channel recently and have been enjoying the videos (I know this is an older one). I am struggling to lose weight, as well, because I do snack a lot and previously drank waaayyy too much. However, one thing I noticed towards the end of your video about Dawn was that you said even if she was healthy during the week, the weekends of going out consistently could cause weight gain. Is the reverse true? For instance, on my three days off work, I only have a couple of black coffees (no cream or any sweetener), water, and a single energy drink (10 calories according to the can). Would I lose weight by continuing this if I had a healthy (low) calorie count on my work days?
Their mother is 120% narcissist. It’s clear that by the time these two were born, whatever safer influence the older kids may have had (a father?? I’m not sure) was not active with them. They were not in a safe environment.
I wish you would&#39;ve talked about what foods are high in protein and fiber that help with weight loss.
I’m an Olympic weightlifter and I do a lot of weight manipulation as a result, recomposing my body, gaining weight, losing weight etc. and weight management is one of the few things in life that is completely within your control
About to break top 10 all time gross :)
Ok, I have to say that if Gwyneth makes her bone broth even a bit similar to the way my mum makes her chicken stock (beef bones for thickness, chicken bones+meat for flavour, boiled for a few hours with bay leaf and all spice, then at the end add some onion, leek, carrot, celery and parsley root, salt and pepper and bring to a boil), then it&#39;s delicious, flavoursome and so wholesome-tasting, I&#39;ll often pour myself a cup to just drink it for the taste and to satiate light hunger.
Is he wrong, they breed boys not men under the umbrella of toxic masculinity
Just saying—I don’t think many people like Gweneth Paltrow. Her company promotes a lot of very expensive products of questionable value. And she is the supreme example of a thin, wealthy, entitled blonde who has no idea how regular people live. That said, she may be anorexic. Especially if she has to “detox” every day and seems obsessed with food.  ???? <br><br>Most healthy people who like to “detox” do a dietary detox on a specific day of the week, or do it for a few days to a week at most seasonally or annually.
As a fat person I can tell you that fat people are fat because of poor dietary choices choosing donuts and pizza over salads and exercise is why you&#39;re fat you&#39;re also a waiting heart attack and diabetes death waiting to happen. No one self-insured wants that Financial liability.
Being fat is gross, unhealthy and not ok. You can do what you want but reality is reality and every fat person would choose to be skinny if it took no work
Ur not fat Jamie✨🤍💕💗🌷💜<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Your bigger then the sun🥰
MY  BROTHERE ALL THE TOME SAY FOR ME THAT IM AGLY AND FAT. 😢 BUT IALWAYS. SONG IT IN THE 🏫 SCHOOL SO IM HAPPY ABOUT WHAT I HAVE. 😊😊 IF IHEAT MY SEALF WHY I TEĹL YOU ❤❤ YES YOU HAVE. Cancer. BUT YOU. ARE NOT. AGLY YOU ARE. OUTGOING GOOD LAKE 👍
Ok not trying to be rude but like any times it’s a girl it’s plus size but a boy is just fat, it’s coming from a girl
Bro skinny shaming and fat shaming are the shame I used to be  fat but I&#39;m skinny now andi get skinny shamed as well
I think they have interpreted the science a little wrong.<br>After a very hard &amp; intense glycolytic work out you are significantly more insulin sensitive. In this state the body is better prepared to handle a meal containing simple carbohydrates with high glycemic index, with out causing a spike in blood sugar and insulin as glucose is more easily directed into skeletal muscle.<br>So if you eat healthily all week a hard work out before a big Sunday lunch can help to<br>off set the carbohydrate load<br>It does not mean that you can  get away with devouring  3 pizzas and a few tubs of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s after a just a 25 minutes on the elliptical machine .
I feel like it&#39;s hard to get nuance into a discussion about health 200 years after the fact. There&#39;s a difference between quantity and quality of life. And just because people were living to old age doesn&#39;t mean they were living to old age and being healthy elderly. I&#39;d be interested to see the rates of CVD and CVA in people who grew up in that golden period with so much consumption of saturated fat. Others have said in the comments section here the article doesn&#39;t discuss things like chronic disease- and they&#39;re right too. It&#39;s all good and well having a robust immune system that can fight off infection, but living under a cloud of smog and sweeping chimneys from the age of 5 is probably going to do a number on your lungs and will put you at risk of conditions like COPD and heart disease. I think another thing people often do gloss over is chronic disease is not a one-and-done- problems like COPD, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease etc can all be problems that take years to progress and manifest themselves as well. You would have to wait some time to see if someone&#39;s intersection of environment and genetics will cause them to to develop CVD, as an example
You know your pretty but Like I will never forgive you for skinny shaming that girl
He announces that he weighs 300 lb and the woman&#39;s reaction is &#39;Baby, congratulations&#39;?!!! He&#39;s gained more weight than I weigh, and I am 5 ft 7 (and used to be 5 ft 8 - collapsed discs due to physically demanding jobs).
Truly though, body weight or fat is really not proportional to what people eat, or even how much they &quot;exercise&quot;. And deprivation always leads to metabolism deregulation and lots of problems anyway. If you line 10 people up and try to guess which ones eat what you&#39;ll find it is only out of luck that you can guess anyone.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE A Jamie has skinny shamed so many people in one of her deleted videos she was was next to her TWIN sister who had CANCER and captioned it<br>&quot;Who&#39;s healthier now?&quot; She&#39;s and awful person. Don&#39;t try to defend her. She doesn&#39;t deserve it. She has said so many awful things and acts like an angel. Why would you say<br>&quot;aww slayy so beautiful.&quot; Or<br>&quot;your so pretty never let anybody bring you down!&quot; When she honestly doesn&#39;t deserve it.<br>If she acted differently and was a good person then sure, support her but she isn&#39;t she&#39;s an awful human
beautiful... two chubby white girls... MONEY... any chubby black girl... poverty/diabetes/disrespected...<br><br><br>good times...
Fat shaming is a good thing only people who disagree are fat asses if you don’t like someone making fun of you got weight lose it and they don’t have equal access to the stuff she said that’s true kinda but it’s a good thing either way
Well there are 3500 cals in a pound so it&#39;s not physically possible to lose a pound of fat in a day.  Not unless you eat literally nothing and are a bodybuilder or about 600lbs. Most of the weight loss is water/lean tissue. Scamming dieters is one thing but selling snake oil to the terminally ill is on a whole other level of evil.
I am totally with you on this!  Do not eat the Pizza and I do not!  Now I do not but earlier in my life i did!  I am 59 years old now and I am now weigh 159.  When I was in my twenties, I used to weigh about 230.  I have been in the proper BMI for my last 20 years.  I feel just like you do!  I feel even now that I am a fat person or at least I have it in me to be a fat person and I have to constantly be vigilant to watch what I eat.  I have learned to watch my caloric intake verses my steps daily and it seems to work for me......Just wished I could quick smoking!  LOL....We all have our vices!
What I hate about kids&#39; makeup is that they think they should and can get away with making it cheap and gross. It&#39;s one thing if you want to think for the parents on making it easy to come off. It&#39;s another when you make it cheap and throw a high ass price on it and call it a day.
And they smell and their women are really  really ugly.
I truly believe Abby uses fat people to boost her own ego and self-esteem
Someone who has used bad habits their whole life, shows they are ON TRACK to use those bad habits for the rest of their life.  Let&#39;s not get into the well super fat is ok, but oh not super, super fat!  Maybe if we stopped apologizing for the truth, more people would be happier, and alive!!!
I love his love for plus women! I pray for a designer dress from him one day. Dreams!
My family is full of bad marriages. My grandfather beat the shit out of my grandmother. Grandma was glad when he died but she had to raise 5 kids on her own. My father ,repeats the same behaviour as his father. Throughout my childhood and teenage years , my parents fought. My father would come home drunk and beat my mom. They are still married but not happy. Its more cordial now. My blood boils when he acts normal as if nothing happend earlier. When you present marriage to a person, i&#39;d rather stay away. I can barely talk to guy. I dont even makeup or dress pretty. My inner child is still struggling. I&#39;d rather die alone than be with a wife beater or a narcissist. How do you sell this idea of marriage to me?
Tati and Scott PLEASE PLEASE do more videos together!! I learned so many tricks and tips from you Scott and seeing it through Tati&#39;s perspective. It&#39;s amazing to see what we can do to get the best makeup that works for our face!  I usually just go with my usual makeup and don&#39;t have a lot of insights on so many more things I can do. PLUS you guys have great working chemistry and sense of humor, which makes it so entertaining &amp; never boring to keep watching TIL THE END! Just bought your stuff, Scott and I can&#39;t wait to try them on!! Thanks both!
I’m sorry but that is disgusting
With a 60 plus percent chance of divorce with an 80 percent chance she files ya miss me with all that.   This isn’t 1950.  The world has changed and marriage is irrelevant.
definitely pretty and cooler bc she looks nicer u skinny shame and make fun of ur dying sister
My question is, why do people care about someone else&#39;s weight? Why can&#39;t people just exist?
I lost 93 lbs since 2019. My biggest wake up call was my husband and I went on a vacation in CA. We did a lot of walking and it was so hard for me. The second was we wanted to go snorkeling and needed a wet suit. None of them fit and I looked at myself in mirror and didn&#39;t like what saw. The 3rd was getting my blood results and everything was high. So I took a honest look at my lifestyle and started working on some of my bad habits. Than those got better and looked at other bad habits I needed to break. I learned as I went. If my weight loss slowed or stopped I adjusted my diet. It&#39;s been slow but effective. One thing that a lot of people do and I did as well in the past was give up if I fell off my diet or hit a bump in the road. Don&#39;t do that push through.
Must be the scariest father talking at ridiculous speed. He would scare the  out my Bella
I do think shame and fear are motivators to lose weight. I met my doctor for the first time in May, the man made me feel ashame of my own behavior. I’m in a weightloss group that deals with weightloss while deal with our thoughts and behaviorsat the same time, but I wasn’t doing the work. After I saw him, I started making things doable for me. Walk everyday, swapped some of my foods, and awareness of my shitty thoughts. Since May 1st I’ve lost almos 15lbs. I joined another group that it’s about fitness. I’m not ready to lift weights but I’m walking almos everyday and eating sweets and the some food I like. I’m learning moderation.
If it was the other way and they were starving their children, there would be swift action. People should have a licence before they breed!!
Instead of educating Americans that eating junk &quot;food&quot; causes permanent deterioration of intellectual abilities, many different diseases such as diabetes, cancer, mental illnesses, the media focuses only on the aspect of weight and tells them that being metabolically ill is OK👍. In America, money comes first, even above children&#39;s health.
Shock therapy is so dumb. These people buy multiple sacs of potatoes, carts full of ice cream, or whatever for themselves to eat, is it really that big of a surprise to see it all combined? On supersize vs super skinny they usually take a component of the food like sugar and show what it’s like on in a different way which maybe is a slightly better way to shock them?
Who is the British person responsible for arbitrating the weight of “a stone”?
STOP FAT SHAMING HER!!!!!!! I get y’all are Mad and stuff but like fr js STOP
Her shopping be like: do you guys have this in a size extra extra extra Extra extra extra extra extra extra large?
Same. I was 260 at my heaviest. I will never be the skinny kid in my heart. Some of my<br>Coworkers think of me as the “skinny guy” despite the fact that I don’t have any veins, my waist is 31”, I have bad cardio, etc.<br>Hearing that they think I’m skinny doesn’t really help. In the moment it might make me feel better about myself, but in the long term it makes me only feel like a fraud… I don’t really handle compliments well because of the time that I was fat and all the fake compliments I got trying to get a rise out of me, no real affection for my entire teenage years through to adulthood.<br>Since losing the weight my confidence has gone up but not to a level where I feel confident. I just feel like I’m constantly on the verge of tears because I have no self-image anymore and I have no idea who to trust.
IS ATYPICAL ANOREXIA THE SAME AS ANOREXIA?<br><br>Atypical anorexia is exactly the same as anorexia, the only difference is that the person doesn’t have a low body weight, or a body weight that the BMI distinguishes as “below normal.” This diagnosis is essential because so many individuals are walking around thinking they must not really have a problem because they “didn’t lose that much/enough weight” to have anorexia or they’re “too big to have anorexia.”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwzAdaa4SkE&amp;t=2m42s">2:42</a> - Shapiro is politely asked to leave a private event by the security and keeps arguing. Disrespects the security agent by insinuating his presence is useless, that he should do better police-things like arresting shooters (even though he isn&#39;t a cop) like it changes anything to the present matter. Besides, Shapiro came with a whole crowd, it&#39;s not &#39;&#39;just him&#39;&#39; and insisting on staying there would be disrupting the peace. Funny how suddenly you&#39;re a little celebrity becomes a freedom fighter when laws apply to them... He&#39;s just an idiot&#39;s idea of an intelligent man.
For almost my entire life, I’ve struggled with eating disorders and being underweight. Starting when I was around five or six I weighed about 50 to 60 pounds  and stayed almost that exact weight, even losing about 5 to 10 pounds on and off until I was about 10 or 11. Even then, when I was well aware that I was underweight, I was still freaking out about being overweight and fat and needing to lose weight. I am now 13 and still struggle with that, but I am much better now.
Guys stop supporting Jaimie!!!! <br>In Jaimies deleted videos she has skinny shamed so many people!!! Excluding her sister that had cancer! She said look who&#39;s healthier now!!!! Now stop saying <br>Slay queen, so pretty, so slay <br>Jaimie this is NOT OK and we DEMAND an apology!!!!
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen anyone else with a fat roll on their forehead. That makes me think there&#39;s more than just an eating disorder. Like, wouldn&#39;t there have to be some metabolic or genetic factor in that? I&#39;m not trying to be rude or disrespectful... identifying factors beyond just behavioral can be a major part of a successful treatment. And congratulations to her for making a positive lasting change
With all the evidence there is to back up JD abusing Amber, I&#39;m unsubscribing. :/ The way the internet treated this case is disgusting. When will people stop treating women who try to speak up about their abuse like trash?
BODY POSITIVE?! IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY WHEN YOU LITERALLY BODY SHAME SKINNY PEOPLE? I&#39;ve had enough of you saying your body POSITIVE when your clearly not
This video is already aging poorly. Your channel also has nothing to do with this topic so you clearly were just trying to make money off the hysteria/hate campaign like every other creator. Totally transparent and gross, you should be ashamed.
WE DEMAND A APOLOGY. SKINNY SHAMING A 16 YEAR OLD IS NOT COOL STOP BEING SO INNOCENT AND SHOW HOW MEAN U ARE ALL BOYS AND GIRLS ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL BODYS TOO. Here is why: she made a vid or smh with her sister who has cancer and made fun of how skinny she is and asked who is healthier.
Has anyone problems with setting spray making their hair gross ?
Lady: what is ur size?<br>Her: XXXXXXXXXXXL💀<br><br><br>Like I would date u💀
Sixty years ago when i was a kid we had sugary cereals, candy, cookies etc.  Yet in my household we had nutritious meals and healthy snacks such as fruit, raw vegetables and dried fruit.  My parents never brought that stuff into the house.  Carbonated beverages were a rare treat, purchased at the Woolworth lunch counter after buying school supplies.  Also unlike school kids today who are mostly bussed to school we walked or rode bikes to school.  At school we had two recesses and gym class a few times a week.  I protested when recesses and gym class were eliminated as cost saving measures as children need to move.  My class growing up had very few chubby kids.  Now obesity and even diabetes are plaguing our kids guaranteeing shorter and sicker lives for our children.  Its time to take control again and saying no to junk food and yes to physically active lives.
At the end of the day, she&#39;s the cause of all of these issues, yet claims none of the responsibility.  You are fat.  You are ugly.  You are a hypocrite to your own beliefs.  The only one to blame is yourself - so it&#39;s good to know you already hate yourself.
I know this video is old, but as a former ballet dancer and knowledgeable in the subject, I want to point out a few things: <br><br>- You can start ballet since you are very young, but you cannot start pointe until you are older and your feet, legs and body are ready. <br><br>- Overweight kids can do ballet, but as they grow, if they want to become professionals, they should be thinner for several reasons, the main one being partnering. Ballet performances have constant lifts, where the male needs to be able to lift you and do all kinds of movements that would be very difficult if the female is overweight. <br>As for pointe, an overweight girl can do pointe, but if she wants to become a professional, she should lose weight. <br><br>- Ballet is hardcore. It is very hard and it requires extreme commitment. It is an amazing exercise, but weight is about eating habits. If you don&#39;t eat right and are overweight because of it, you might lose a couple of pounds with ballet, but you will still be overweight with muscles. You need to eat right. <br><br>- There are so many other elements required to become a professional ballet dancer, such as the shape of your legs and feet, etc., that I won&#39;t discuss them here. <br><br>My sister is a former principal dancer and lead ballet dancer of our country. She currently owns a school and trains dancers. She went through a lot growing up because because of the weight restrictions in ballet. They would give her a fine for every pound she was overweight. She went through eating disorders because of it. She wasn&#39;t even overweight, she just has very muscular legs, which required her to loose even more weight. <br><br>Now, she does everything in her power not discourage or traumatize young girls that want to dance. She allows all kinds of people to dance in her school if they want. However, if a girl is serious about becoming a professional, my sister talks to them privately about the things that the girl could/should do, and encourages and guides them to get better physically (including weight) and become better dancers.
STOP BULLYING HER SHE JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN AND U MAKE FUN OF HER BC U THINK SHES FAT U GUYS ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE . PEOPLE CAN&#39;T JUST GET FAT BC OF FOOD THEY CAN FAT BC OF Health SO STOP BULLYING SHE IS pretty . ITS NOT UR BUSINESS TO JUST BULLY PEOPLE IF U THINK U ARE A GOOD PERSON REMEMBER IF U MAKE FUN OF FAT PEOPLE OR NOT 😢
This is actually a true face of depression. It&#39;s not being sad with some sad music in your head as they portrait it in movies. Nope. It&#39;s anger, it&#39;s personality degrading, it&#39;s tantrums, it&#39;s derealisation, it&#39;s loosing any connection with people around you. People do not like that part of depression. It&#39;s ugly and horrifying illness which will make your whole personality rott.
Yup she hates fat people.
I dint know what&#39;s more: &quot;depressing or plain stupidity&quot;. Peorple like this woman, push for an ideal, which is actually more self defeating to their race/culture. Muslims in the U.S.A. is a perfect example. Muslims in this country are here, because it&#39;s a better life. The kind of life, the world of Islam which would deny them all the freedoms and prosperities they take for granted here! As for gays, feminists and far lefts? Don&#39;t even get me started.
The name is a bit off putting, but I actually like the show. I do like that in general they try to avoid super skinny people that would be unfit for the show, like folks who have anorexia and who need deeper therapeutic help to eat more.
It almost seems with fat positivity, that weve arrived in a world were you can deliberatly buy breath mints that make your breath stink of shit, on purpose, and a lot of them look as though they dont need them...
HAVE to make it partially political since she mentioned it: It amazes me she cannot FATHOM the very same media clowns are why DJT is hated. The very same tactics. Straight up LIES printed and never taken back in any meaningful way.
I am ugly!!!!!
This is why I prefer the term &quot;calorie excess&quot; to &quot;overeating&quot; because it&#39;s a clearer term.  You can consume too many calories and not feel full and therefore not feel you are overeating.
I recommend you watch some of Jason Fung’s videos on the role of insulin/resistance on the failure to lose weight.
Jaimie, I&#39;m not new to your channel, but I want to apologize about my rude comments in my alt accounts that I lost, if you happen to read one of my rude comments, then I&#39;m sorry for body shaming you, I want you to get better and healthy but calling you mean stuff is not the way to go, I&#39;ve noticed how these comments were even worse than when you said that skinny shaming is not real, I&#39;m really sorry about my rude comments and I hope you have a wonderful day and stay healthy ^^!
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
Thst goes down to your legs the STOMACH im not fat shaming but that has to be fake
Ashley,you are a hero. Never seen so funny and motivating workout videos like yours. I am sure that many plus-size people feel good to see that they can do workouts and  don´t need to start like a slim sporty person.
Every scrawny twiggy little tiny man thinks the tough guys are awesome
When NDT is explaining something and emphasizes a word it&#39;s like getting slapped with it. 🤣
a lot of the time the superskinny ones are just normal weight with a shit diet
Big girl here, wouldn’t wear anything more than a bikini for swimming, because fat girl swimsuits are made for beach wales.  They put far too much cloth to look modest, but all that material ain’t comfortable for swimming and definitely not staying indefinitely wet in. Women who wear something like that typically won’t take a splash of water.
It&#39;s clear her panties are definitely a few sizes too small!
Tata can I just say I’m so happy that you and James worked things out. You speak of him with such love and when you two are on camera and or share the two of you on IG you can see the love you have for each over. Remember God is great and he will never forsake you. Much love all the way from Arizona ❤<br><br>PS. Went to Dallas about 6 weeks ago I was so hoping I would run into you just by miracle. I obviously didn’t but dear I say it was way hotter there than Arizona due to the humidity you all have. Plus it didn’t hep that we were staying at the Gaylord resort and the water is right there. 😂
despite amy&#39;s weight loss and motivation story, you all should know that these sisters are scammers and animal abusers. If you don&#39;t know the story, go watch Sunny V2&#39;s video on it.
1 ) she over flowed the hot tub  ( 2) she filled the whole villa too (3) she skinny shamed 16 yr old
As someone that used to be obese when I was younger, I feel the  &quot;junkfood&quot;  effect  just hearing the word TLC . And I could get &quot;psychological diabetes&quot; if I watch too much of it. So thank you for balancing it out with some healthy insight!
You aren&#39;t fat
This is so confusing.  i dont know whats higher my grades or your weight
Tbh i would hate to have to gain weight   Eating alot is hard
speaking as a fat guy myself... yes, if a person is overweight, they are eating far too much.
This movie: Portrays the struggles of an obese man in his every day life.<br>Fat positivity: <b>*in a whinny voice*</b> But why would you show it that way???? Waaaaahhhh!<br><br>Because is reality, you cry baby.
I personally know three people that’s had this surgery, sadly after a few years all three gained the weight back.
If anyone is confused. She skinny shamed people and people told her &quot;you aren&#39;t In a good mental state&quot; she then said to them &quot;that&#39;s fatphobic&quot; she makes her being plus sized her whole personality. She does nothing to fix her weight.  She doesn&#39;t do anything to help herself. Instead she skinny shamed people and told them they where fatphobic for telling her to help herself. She would tell people that they where too skinny and that they were fatphobic for trying to help her. One of her videos showed her yearbook photo when she was a kid. She was like this since a kid. She did NOTHING to help. So all y&#39;all that think I&#39;m being rude, I&#39;m not. She skinny shamed and acted like she was the victim when she isn&#39;t. She played the victim card and acted like she was the victim. She wasn&#39;t she would tell people that they were too skinny. People that told her she needed to help herself and that she wasn&#39;t in a good mental state
That stomach size
Carnivore diet is super cool to try, I have tried it and I felt amazing; I had binge eating episodes and with canivore diet (high fat high protein) I didn&#39;t have one! though I missed the freshness of veggies so I added green beans and it was amazing! <br>I&#39;d say that canivore diet really helped with my depression and my sensory sensitivity (misophonia). Give it a try and see for yourself if it benefits you.
Hi Tati, imagine squeezing your shoulders when pressing.. you’ll see that the weight just kinda goes up on it’s own. Just keep thinking about “squeeze, squeeze”.. this helped me. Good luck!
Nikado avocado is skinny compared to you
Honestly think they did her more harm than good. Only thing that benefited her change was the exposure and accountability. Them purposely sneak feeding her ham was horrible.  <br><br>I&#39;m glad you brought attention to many of the other factors that could explain a person&#39;s food &quot;addiction&quot;, but you didn&#39;t discuss the way those foods act on her brain. Carbs give us a rush, the fats make it last longer, so even eating this a few times a week would make you crave it so you could feel that good again. She has years of memories of this food combo being safe, delicious, and making her feel good - that is something that will take a long time of continuous effort to counteract.
maybe it wasn’t the maneater palette that made you “feel ugly”, maby you was just pms’ing❤
This family is a bigger mess than Amber-Lynne Reed.
hi do you have dumb not beautiful feet if so i have just the product for you<br><br>Nothing but pure beauty. Tosses and turns. Plus, it&#39;ll wipe right on your foot and looks so smooth. My feet do burn, but with this product they do not. I own two. Not exactly ideal with winter and we&#39;re all about comfort right? These beauties make a great gift, or, you could wear them as holiday or office shoes or socks. &quot;Boots&quot; must be great for the hills I was tempted to split them into two articles.
Yea it’s not that gross when women you don’t know have hairy pits, most men have hairy pits I mean if she was a attractive model yea it’d be weird but not something to trip over.
People will laugh at u cause ur overweight but they will be mean because ur skinny I don&#39;t understand People
The only thing unhealthy is your weight mate
It’s okay to be fat - it’s not okay to be unhealthy -
It’s not just choices. When nutritious food is way more expensive than cheap junk food, then something is wrong. Those who don’t have the income end up fatter and malnourished.
After the scenes with the fat girls you look superb in my eveys
According to me body positivity is not mocking someone for his/her looks- height, weight, hair etc. Every obese person knows that s/he is fat and need to weight loss. But for some people losing weight is tough maybe because of thyroid, pcod or other disease. We need to be supportive and empathetic to them. But some people misunderstand body positivity and thinks that being fat is fine. No it is not. Your body is temple and start worshipping it otherwise we cant adapt tha changing climate.
When society fixes it self then abortion shouldnt be allowed. But rape, and health can cause a mother to die from being pregnant. This is very true with rape. That offpring reminds them of the incident. Plus we have a population problem.

the weight you lose would be the money in your pocket
What’s interesting is that I doubt she even believes she’s truly happy. She likely feels defeated by the thought of losing weight, through misconceptions and maybe past attempts, so she’s trying to secure validation to soothe herself.
fat shaming and skinny shaming actually the same
How can I gain weight? I eat nothing but BULLSHIT all day long. How much calorie can there be in TOTAL BULLSHIT?
Encouraging people to be obese, and encouraging assisted suicide, are both the same thing.  Encouraging people to end everything to end pain instead of addressing that mental pain.
Father did a bear service for his kids. They would love the gesture now, but not later in life
Jeffree Star aka Skinny Legend: &quot;I&#39;m a food/candy addict&quot;<br><br>Me: looks at gut, does inside
The only thing bigger than the amount of evidence for obesity being dangerous is the size of the asses of the people who push that narrative.
She doesn’t need to answer anything she doesn’t want to. Y’all need to understand that celebrities aren’t entitled to answer your questions. It doesn’t make them disgusting or rude
Thanks for the recommendations! Picked up the Catrice palette and bronzer &amp; also their Drunk&#39;n Diamonds plumping lip balm in 020. Love all of them! Such pretty colours!
