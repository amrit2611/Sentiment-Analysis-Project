Jeffree Your vest is ugly What are you doing
Not even joking, Jeffree Star saved my life. And I&#39;m not talking about, ok, he influenced me and follow him and blah blah blah, I&#39;m not a super fan or anything... no offense to Jeffree! I just hate TickTok, Instagram, basically any social media forms! Lol call me old fashioned. But anyways... No one should ever be mean to Jeffree! That&#39;s one bad ass person, now I haven&#39;t seen anything he&#39;s done recently and haven&#39;t been following anything he&#39;s been doing, sorry bud, but I was friends with him back in the days of MYSPACE! before anyone really knew knew who he really was, before he got so popular. I mean he was popular, of course, but not to the level he is now. And he would actually talk to me messages here and there when we just needed to get shit out. He hated to share anything... Hated to let people in, but when he does, he&#39;s the most amazing fucking person. <br>I was in a huge fight with my boyfriend one night... I had no one, I was home all alone. I logged onto MySpace, and no one was there for me when I needed to talk. They were all about their problems and their own selfishness. I sat there for for over an hour trying so hard to find someone to talk to. Finally Jeffree signed on and just wrote a message that said HEY GIRL! I broke down and said shits so hard. He said, GIRL TALK! Not even 5 mons earlier, I was about to sign off and no joke, was going to kill myself, nothing in my life was going right, my Godfather had died, my best friend passed away the week earlier too, then my boyfriend was about to leave me, and if it weren&#39;t for me just staying on for 5 more mins on that damn computer and talking to the most amazing JEFFREE in the world, I would NOT be here today. He saved my life. For an entire hour of trying to find out if all my friends to talk to and none of them wanted to talk to Me, my CLOSE SO CALLED FRIENDS! They only wanted to talk about themselves, yet Jeffree was there, and he had never let me before in person, we just messaged back and forth on Myspace, He had days where he would vent to me and I&#39;d vent to him, that&#39;s what we did. I&#39;m so upset I lost touch with him, because I never got to truly TRULY thank him for saving my life. I have a beautiful 9yr old daughter now, and even though I&#39;ve been battling bone cancer and can&#39;t work, I have nothing, and it&#39;s so so hard some days to even get through the day.  When you can&#39;t work, you have no money, and with no money, you can&#39;t live, I&#39;ve lost 50 lbs in a week because I have to make sure my daughter eats which means that I just am not able to eat sometimes, but after all that... All I have to do is look back and just remember that conversation I had with Jeffree. I&#39;m telling you. It brings me right back to the mentality of I KNOW IVE FUCKING GOT THIS! And I can&#39;t even begin to explain to you people, there is not enough words in the English language, or any language, to describe how thankful I am for JEFFREE STAR and what he has done for me. I know he will never read this but I wish so so badly that someone could get him a message from me just telling him THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MOST AMAZING YOU, AND DONT EVER CHANGE! Thank you Jeffree Star for saving my life. I know I could never repay you, because you can&#39;t possibly give anything to a person to someone whom has everything, especially when I have nothing to even give, but if I could, I would. I&#39;d give him my heart, my love and anything I could possibly give him to give him the world! <br>You&#39;re the best Jeffree and I hope one day this message finds you so you can know I truly appreciate you. Thank you!
I don&#39;t understand how someone can take such ugly such unpigmented colors and still make it look gorgeous Jeffree can literally make ANYTHING look good

Yeah, WY has 1 day of summer. It snows in July, August, ect. Good thing you get to leave whenever you want cuz that state sucks. I&#39;m assuming the no state tax is part of what attracted you tho. Could you help out the wild horses because ranchers there are the reason they&#39;re being corraled and sold off for meat cuz they don&#39;t want them grazing on their many hundreds of acres. It&#39;s disgusting

Yeah, WY has 1 day of summer. It snows in July, August, ect. Good thing you get to leave whenever you want cuz that state sucks. I&#39;m assuming the no state tax is part of what attracted you tho. Could you help out the wild horses because ranchers there are the reason they&#39;re being corraled and sold off for meat cuz they don&#39;t want them grazing on their many hundreds of acres. It&#39;s disgusting
Noooo.. I look fat 😂😂

Are we not gonna talk about how beautiful James looks right now 💖💖💖😊
You look so beautiful girl !
I am a 49 year old woman. I do not ware make up often i hate the way it feels on my skin it makes me feel claustrophobic . Living in south Georgia U.S.A is another reason it is too dang hot to ware make up. I will ware a tinted gloss and a nude shadow from time to time and call it a day. Maybe when i have to renew my drivers license in 2025 i will get my make up professionally done being i do not know how to do it. He always looks beautiful and does such an amazing job . I really like his content.
Wow you have really awesome facial expression!! Also beautiful. Nice video!
Omg you’re beautiful ❤️

Beautiful morning

James u cheated for eyeshadow you used more than 1 dip because you used different colour’s
😂fEature like a blind girl dogo
Makeup to look like your face got punched in is a great look for James
Its sad seeing some popular creators grow out of doing videos, but love how james is still passionate and pulling through with such great content 💜
how about you eat purple foods or blue foods??
James, I don’t care what you say, you’re a great cook!!
you do know that tesla&#39;s have a feature on the screen that allows you to see behind you without having to look in the side mirrors you do now that write
I’m sorry about the only one who realized when she said, what size was going to be on his body for the rest of his life am I the only one who saw that I actually smudged
IF IT&#39;S SUNSCREEN WHY DID HE EAT IT AT THE START
Who&#39;s here before Benny recreate it?

Blood, sweat &amp; tears you say??<br><br>A<br>R<br>M<br>Y
The mistakes you make you could just make them out of a creation
“Let’s not think about her”. Even tho she CREATED the whole world and everything Harry Potter.
I just bought the whole painted set and I love it! I’ve created some awesome looks with it, and the formula is PERFECT💗
I have two Pygmy goats and all they do is eat 😂 goats have 3 stomachs so they feet very hungry 😋

What I&#39;m planning to do with that is to invest into real estate. It would be a dream come true and a life changing for me and my family. Best of luck to everyone
sO yOu tHiNk iM sKiNny got me laughing so hard😂😂
TREAT ME LIKE A bLIND GIRLS DOG
You&#39;re so skinny.
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
James........Im a GROWN woman.....this was HILARIOUS. Great job! (&amp;&amp; team!)
Literally going blind in my right eye too can barely function and the media is all like… more death threats!!! How sweet ❤

At first I thought is whip cream but is sunscreen but WHY DID YOU EAT THE SUNSCREEN JAMES
✨Jamesss✨ u cant solve world hunger by EATING SO MUCH 💕💕
The One Size one performed worse than the ones rated lower. 👀
When I am to skinny to ride any wild adventure rides
One size on till dawn one wasn&#39;t as good as the other ones before that but that&#39;s just me
<b>gasp</b> &quot;so you think I&#39;m skinnYYYYYYYYYY&quot; got me dieing 💀
James: I’m either gonna be on the toilet for the whole rest of the day or die<br>Me: 🤨 being very concerned <br>Him still eating it: this slays <br>Me: you said it your self queen🪦🪦💀
I love how you’re able to make fun of yourself &amp; have fun with this campaign. Came out great
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
a petition for james to recreate this look
“Goats can spend 14 hours a day, eating. Mood hello that is me.”<br>Also james: “I’m a skinny legend”
Nickel, boat,Mary,cat,,umbrella,eat
What does he even do his make up for, or is he just at home with a full glam look?looks great though
Not his shirt looking like those heatless curlers 😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>love u james ♥
Why did you eat it james😢
When you just got braces and this pops up on your for you page and can’t eat anything that looks so good in James videos 😢
Why did James eat it
Bro.. just discovering you and I love the video, but do you breathe at all when talking lol 😅 much love❤️
“You just popped a Molly” “I’m sweatin”
What does he even do his make up for, or is he just at home with a full glam look?looks great though
size might not matter but do you know what does ? the age of consent ❤
Why did he Eat it tho😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can i ask, why you don&#39;t like magnetic lashes? I can&#39;t do normal lashes to save my life! I have tried for years, i tried magnetic and i LOVE them, so easy to use, and i wear liner every day anyway, so i can also cut them down and just have them at the end of the eye to lift my hoodes eyes, and the full lash totally covers them so i look more awake, i don&#39;t wear anything else but lip oil and lashes, and i look great! So im just curious why you don&#39;t like them? Love your channel hun 😊 hi from the uk 🇬🇧 x
I feel like kailin should have won . Cuz her idea was wayyyy more original and unique than anyone. Even tho Ashley&#39;s look was great I couldn&#39;t see any trend for it. Feeling sad for kailin
&quot;EEEEEEEUUHHH SO YOU THINK IM SKINNYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot;<br><br>Boiii what😭😭😭
All of care about is the dog like anybody with me ☺️😂
Ik it&#39;s just all the trends together but I feel like using really full coverage foundation after underpainting like defeats the purpose of it
I&#39;d eat it don&#39;t I mean DONT GET ME THIS my first thought would be SPRAY IT IN YOUR MOUTH NOW! 😂😂😂😂
It looks so good omg can I eat it
The mistakes you make you could just make them out of a creation
Bru the one size was an 11/10 when it literally smudged😂
But the real question is did he eat the SUNSCREEN <br><br>👇
I tried this and it worked great! Time to impress Kevin ❤️❤️❤️
Why does camera man james have such thick eyebrows
James: Catches whipped cream in mouth*<br>Also James: ITS SUNSCREEN <br><br><br>Me: Bro why u be eating it?
Nickel, boat,Mary,cat,,umbrella,eat
I just spotted this on Back To Hogwarts day today (9/1/23) and it is everything I needed ! Thanks for this tutorial. It inspires me to make some delicious magical treats tonight!
Size dosent matter but age does
lmao was it just me or did the caterpillar brows get thicker every time they cut to that era of james😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
Boy that make-up gloss that stops you from eating is the BEST idea I ever heard on shark tank! 🦈 I would back her company for FREE and just give her the money she needs.
I don&#39;t know the details but from what I know it was just a misunderstanding, you should all stop trying to cancel everyone and find some happiness I&#39;m your life. I&#39;m sure he felt terrible and didn&#39;t know, if he didn&#39;t, shame on him but we don&#39;t know. SO STOP HATING.
I’d eat it if my mom didn’t tell me that it was sunscreen
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
Blood, sweat &amp; tears you say??<br><br>A<br>R<br>M<br>Y
That hack is great
Bro he&#39;s asking if he looks good like was there even a question<br>  <br><br><br><br>He can pull anything off<br><br>From a dress to,sweats and oversized sweaters
But can u still eat it?
The Eyeshadow one with the tissue is actually one that I&#39;ve done before 👍<br>Great hack 👍<br>And James approved apparently 👍
The milk was better than one size the milk one didn’t much like at all
I should eat only green so you can be healthy and &quot;SKINNY&quot; 💚🍏😝
&quot;sIzE dOeS mAtTeR&quot; 💀💀💀💀💀
I can’t even do makeup 💄 with my eyes open let alone closed
OMG I LOVE THIS ADD SMMM GREAT JOB JAMES
Why did you eat it💀💀💀💀💀
I saw the video you treat the girl bad<br>You should be ashamed
Wonderful Video James Charles And Crew!  Everything James Charles And His Crew Create Turns Into Gold!  Who sings the song Between 24 secs and 27 secs into the video?
Not his shirt looking like those heatless curlers 😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>love u james ♥
Oml you look great if I did this I would look like I tried and hit my head on a rock and as I got up ended up slipping face first into mud
You are a great singer slayyy
Size matters thats why you dont get importance
You gave the one size and 11/10... even tho it literally smeared worse than the product before. You might not do sponsors, but you&#39;re definitely biased
Hopefully, you have a great day 😊😊😊😊😊❤😂😂
Just came from James&#39;s IG story renting out a theatre to watch Hunger Games where the theatre also showed this very commercial of the painted palette instead of the regular previews --- and I just wanted to say that I&#39;m sorry for being 2 weeks late to this masterpiece!! The content, the delivery , the promotion.... Perfect!
I was about to go to the store and buy came to eat it😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The foundation at first was giving Flashback Mary but it turned out gorge, thanks for the great content once again!
Its scary how easily the world forgets... Shame on ya&#39;ll
Okay but I LOVE THIS! Self awareness, satire, self promo, and most of all, it’s not not ground breaking, it’s close to the heart. Will be adding to my collection.
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
Bro.. just discovering you and I love the video, but do you breathe at all when talking lol 😅 much love❤️
plus: retro-Royalties
oh, so you think I’m skinnyyyyyyyyyyy
J.  is just naturally beautiful  his facial features are so unique.   I love how He is making us feel  like we all are on line chatting with him    I think he is doing exactly was he is meant to do  .  He is classy  and funny  just the type of person  I so would hang out with   Jeff is our ROCK STAR for sure   I cheer up when I watch his channel..  Refreshing  STAY U Sir Jeffreeeee 😊
y&#39;all Jeffree with eyebrows scared me- my body wasn&#39;t prepared
Omg that is horrible. Hope your lashes were ok. That stuff looked unsafe. Hope you managed to rinse and repeat it away
Eating Oreos while watching you
I literally can’t stop staring at your sweater 😍
it&#39;s funny cuz the cheapest natural highlighter is just sweat...
Eat pink food for one day😂
That sweater though 😍
Give that weight loss gloss and a gym sis
Bad weather and roads in grand forks ND too. Working for a delivery company over the holidays is insane for us. Over 20k packages behind lol
As she&#39;s telling everybody to not go after Jeffrey, while in the same sentence,  calling out his flaws. She&#39;s such a phony.
When I am to skinny to ride any wild adventure rides
Your teeth look fab!  So white &amp;beautiful also the makeup looks great on you....I have to say I&#39;m definitely more daring w my eyeshadow colors becoz of you!!!  Also u always pick up my sad mood when I&#39;m feeling debby downer...keep it up love!  Your a doll
I have Eczema on my eyes and face sometimes when I do my makeup it’s looks so dry that sometimes I can’t even wear makeup without it looking so dry and gross
I’m shocked he liked these products at all because I work in a makeup store and I HATE the it products. He might’ve only like it because he could afford to not have a single pore and perfect skin. The guest I try the cc cream on are regular ppl that can’t afford laser treatments and it separates on them and looks cakey. I’m always so confused when people say they love it bc all I could see is the way it separates on their skin but 🤷🏽‍♀️
If it wasn’t sunscreen I would eat it 😅
Man , they look so good 😋<br>How unlucky i am that I won&#39;t be able to eat that 🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭
IT LOOKS SO PRETTY ON YOU, YOU REALLY CREATED A PRETTY LOOK!!! BUT CMON U ARE ALSO STUNNING!!
I think Jeffree should do a Hot Topic collab. Their makeup isn&#39;t great and it would be a throwback to his merch from the myspace days.
elf is like the nerd with full-on ideas but nobody really supports it (them, she, he)
One size on till dawn one wasn&#39;t as good as the other ones before that but that&#39;s just me
Nobody notice how he accidentally said foundation instead of concealer
Watching Jeffery high asf at 2 in the morning eating a banana pudding milkshake is a vibe🧚🏾🤍💭☁️
Its scary how easily the world forgets... Shame on ya&#39;ll
“You just popped a Molly” “I’m sweatin”
Wonderful Video James Charles And Crew!  Everything James Charles And His Crew Create Turns Into Gold!  Who sings the song Between 24 secs and 27 secs into the video?
That make up looks great! ❤
You&#39;re so skinny.
Jeffrey: Who watches YouTube and eats popcorn? <br>Me:as I stuff my mouth with a hand full of popcorn 🤣
Recomended after the corona thing? Anybody?
I love how he doesn&#39;t judge any makeup until he actually tries it and he compliments makeup that is cheaper because not everyone can afford the top of the line makeup . That&#39;s great because I&#39;m guessing there are many fans that can only afford more affordable brands. It would be cool if she subscribed to boxycharm or ipsy and do try one with the makeup that many of us get to try only in sub boxes
Hi girl can you maybe review beauty creation cosmetics in the future please I would love it so much.
I love how she closes one lid with the other one not twitching.
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
Thick moisturiser pretty much does the same as this 😂
Pls recreate Disney movie makeup looks !!!!
a good dupe to this tatcha moisturiser is the neutrogena hydro boost gel moisturiser! great for any skin type! it has stayed my top favorite for years :)
Okay but I LOVE THIS! Self awareness, satire, self promo, and most of all, it’s not not ground breaking, it’s close to the heart. Will be adding to my collection.
Elf is a good makeup for the price ..you can’t beat it
Close ur eyes nd listen to it
Size doesn’t matter No it’s not giving
The short hair looks so much better on Jeffree. His face comes into its own much more. He looks great with long hair or a wig, of course, but with short hair he doesn&#39;t look so dramatically moderate and looks more likeable. This hairstyle reflects his true inner self. Just nice and normal. I hope you don&#39;t get me wrong 😊 I like Jeffree&#39;s way. I love how honest he is, no matter who is behind the makeup brand. I&#39;ve only been watching his videos for a short time. Of course, I&#39;ve known him for a long time, but had never really seen his videos. I find him sympathetic.. I have no idea what kind of drama there was with Him, and I don&#39;t care. I also know that many have canceled jeffree, but have no idea why ^^
I should eat only green so you can be healthy and &quot;SKINNY&quot; 💚🍏😝
Gurl I had eaebuds in &quot;SKINNY&quot; 😂😅
Bro go eat A-
your so ugly
&quot;EEEEEEEUUHHH SO YOU THINK IM SKINNYYYYYYYYYYYY&quot;<br><br>Boiii what😭😭😭
or you can just open the can and drink. open the bottle and drink. i admire the creativity though 10/10
Great video, more usefull info 8 minutes than I&#39;ve learned in a lifetime
I was obese , but nowhere even close to these people, but I was conscious that I needed to lose weight at the age of 58.<br>My problem was binge eating late at night.<br>I went and had a blood test and thankfully no problems.<br>I went on to the carnivore diet as did my wife and it&#39;s been amazing.<br>See have both had steady weight loss, better sleep and so much energy.<br>We swim for 1 hour every day and feel as if we were in our 20&#39;s.<br>Our mantra is &quot;Nothing tastes as good as thin feels&quot;
this is so wild! great video
I remember this episode, especially once that father guy said he&#39;s from Poland therefore he knows all about the mushrooms. Now I see his wife shares that belief.<br>As a Polish person I swear I don&#39;t have a clue what they mean. Of course we have mushrooms in Poland but they are not especially important to most traditional (or &quot;traditional passing&quot;) recipes. I&#39;m also surprised by the lack of Polish accent?
Shame jojo is like the only one who still talks to het
Serena 😍 Great content!
God forbid children are gonna have fun when they are trying to lose weight
your so ugly
I actually disagree with a lot of this.  Filters aside, these women these girls are crying over are putting in work these girls are not putting in.  They have their hair done, they have their makeup on, they&#39;re watching their nutrition, they&#39;re working out, they&#39;re dressing carefully, and - yes - they&#39;re probably under a filter or two.  These girls are just crying.  They&#39;re not even wearing any makeup.  I&#39;m not saying women MUST wear makeup to be beautiful, but if you want to look like the women wearing tons of makeup, you&#39;re going to have to put some on.  Even they don&#39;t look the way they do wearing makeup when they&#39;re not wearing makeup.  You&#39;re not going to get the same results if you&#39;re not putting in any of the effort.  Most blatant example, the significantly overweight girl in the opening hugging herself as the audio plays something like &quot;I wish I knew what it was like to be seen as beautiful.&quot;  Fix your nutrition. That&#39;s all you.  No, don&#39;t run off half-cocked, develop an eating disorder, recover, and come back claiming all nutrition management efforts are toxic diet culture.  Do it right.  You can&#39;t expect the same results when you&#39;re not putting in the same efforts. Aspirational is but should not be a four letter word.  Either legitimately strive - no crash diets, shortcuts, or other bullshit - to be what you want to be or accept how you are without insisting others do too.  Sorry, BP - body positivity - obesity will never cute, for example.  Lets stop this headlong run for a &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;-style society.
Let that individual go home and treat himself...no one sees that the man is sick and suffering<br>Now I understand better..woke means that cowardly and worthless character, who blames the past to be able to do whatever the rot in him wants...
I loved watching this!  Great relationship and wonderful family!
You are absolutely so real and awesome. Thank you for everything your love for make up your life for your animals your love for the great outdoors. You are entirely my favorite Shirley Katherine in  Phoenix.
Many people do not understand carbs. Carbs are also some kind of sugar, so you should avoid them and rather eat complex carbs than simple ones. Best is doing sports and eat lots of proteins to gain muscles. More muscles, more energy you need, if you eat less than you need, you lose weight. Also just eat 2 times a day, to keep insolin level low, which is important to lose weight.
Is anybody else here after seeing &quot;sucking d and c&quot; 😂😂
I’m new and yet I’m subbed.GREAT JOB!
Always we have options and choices,  do not blame food companies, do not buy and don&#39;t eat, if we r fat it us over fault.
fun fact amy is even slimmer now but tammy is still very obese
I appreciate that emphasized that Schenee is exhibiting behaviors that we all have plenty of experience with. You&#39;re not talking about her as if she is impossible to relate to, even to the extent of explaining her cruel treatment of her husband as a symptom of her denial. Very classy way of presenting the subject matter.
people mistake emotions as a part of physical health. All because you value yourself now and don&#39;t put all your worth on weight and looks, doesnt mean you should spiral into an eating disorder of the opposite. It&#39;s still an eating disorder. It&#39;s still killing you quicker than a normal human.
the biggest thing to stop eating so much junk food is realising that it doesnt even actually taste good
Deep discount of $25000!!! Ha ha ha.<br>The irony is that eating a diet very, very high in plants, and the benefits of glutathione ARE there. But loads of coffee enemas, and losing weight by dehydration??? Just chuck out the processed crap, eat more plants (with the fibre still in), and drink enough water…. I can promise you, you WILL get healthier. <br>Thanks. You can send your few thousands dollars to me at….
Does not want is face associated with his beliefs and stance - what a first class moron - hope he has GREAT trouble finding anyone to employ him.  All those people like him are ripe for hell. 🇬🇧🇮🇱✡️✝️
Great interview lovely women
I think, and I could very well be wrong is this is a bunch of saber rattling by China and creating an enemy out of the US. Xi is trying to get an unprecedented third term and what better way to rile up the votes than to push reunification (which got him elected the first go around) and to focus everyone on a common enemy, the US. China has tried to take back Taiwan like two or three times already and has failed each time and honestly with their banks already imploding I don’t think they could sustain any kind of long engagement short of bombing the sh!t out of everything.
By law you aren&#39;t even allowed to shoot for TV within a real restaurant that is being used by people who didn&#39;t approve anything.<br>Not only that, how many times does it happen that these restaurants sell pure trash but people keep coming?<br>Remember what adults told you back in the day, they wer right, EVERYTHING ON TV IS FAKE.<br>Same for youtube these days, everything behind a person is a add and nobody is gonna make a movie without having thought about that.<br>It is not just all over the top, it is so far over the top that it just becomes obvious how fake it is.
I was chubby as a child, imagine going to fat camp, and then realized, &quot;bruh i can literally lose weight myself&quot;
I&#39;m a natural kinda woman. The loud make-up doesn&#39;t work for me like the natural look doesn&#39;t work for others. I think you look great. 😁
Yes as a parent I have full control over what my child eats because I’m the one buying the food. It’s as simple as that. <br>I buy food and he has no choice but to eat what I’ve brought for him.

Wow - Noor is absolutely fascinating! What a smart,  inspirational young woman! This was a great interview!
Never forget Elaine Welteroth revived Vogue Teens out of fashion death and made it relevant to young Gen Z, love her trailblazing a$$ in the fashion/editorial world. Just watch her interview here, literally creating a title for herself as an intern and negotiating a salary on her own - talk about manifesting exactly what you want out of life.
I know this may fly in the face of the video but - Do they have a &quot;Skinny Camp&quot;. I&#39;M NOT KIDDING. My whole life I&#39;ve been underweight. My parents are scared for me. I USED TO try justify it as &quot;Oh but at least I&#39;m not fat...&quot;<br><br>But now I wonder if it could be just as bad as being fat (NOT OBESE though. I&#39;m well aware obesity is still worse). But the lock of Iron and Protein in my body had my doctors concerned. ESPECIALLY my neurologist because she warned my low iron in my blood could actually reduce the effectiveness of my seizure medication.<br><br>Recently I HAVE had a protein increase (and NOT via an expensive protein shake) but...NOW I&#39;m reading how all these oils in peanut butter ain&#39;t so good. I work from home so this past year finally started cooked FROZEN food (But oven food not microwave) so I have to watch my salt but...No issues yet .<br><br>BAH! THE THING IS I WON&#39;T LISTEN TO A NUTRITIONIST! (I WILL listen to my neurologist above the Vitamin D and Calcium pills though because I REFUSE the stop skiing and don&#39;t plan on losing my bones any time soon...)<br><br>EDIT: It is NOT my family&#39;s fault. They ALWAYS offer up whatever fresh meal they made. And recently I&#39;ve actually STARTED JOINING THEM since I work 3rd shift at home...
What a waste of money and the styles are just ugly.. you always make me laugh so much.. ❤️
I am a really lazy person when it comes to cooking. I am single and always buy food from restaurants. But since I got an air fryer I cook my meals literally in 20 min. No cooking skills required and countless recipes can be found online. Combining with physical exercise (weightlifting and little bit of cardio) and avoiding processed food and sugar as much as possible,  I managed to drop my weight from 190lbs to 176lbs in just 6 weeks. I feel so great, lighter and more energetic now. ❤
My mom has like a life size replaced of Dobby in the hospital she works at but it&#39;s in the O R so the 🧦 that Harry gave to him is in a vacuum sealed bag in Dobby&#39;s hand and I love it😂
Tati what do you think of Catrice?  I&#39;ve heard that they and Essence are run by the same parent company.  I love Essence and have heard great things about Catrice as well, but Catrice is harder to find and purchase in Canada....
Secret eating was a hurdle I had to seriously overcome to push past my plateau at 200lb😅
I’m living for that sweater
This was phenomenal! It’s crazy watching this movie 30 years! I remember when the first one came out 😁 it was a phenomenal movie in it’s time and Tom did a great job!
I get why adults try to encourage children to try new foods, it is good for them to do so, but I will never understand why they attempt to force feed foods that are already known to make the child gag. All it does is create a bad memory in the best possible scenario, or an aversion, and maybe even a phobia, in the worst case. <br><br>My mom did the same thing with me and fish (in my case, orange roughy, not even deliciously cooked, but STEAMED, with no seasoning other than a little margarine. I was made to sit at the table for hours, choking it down as if it was a punishment. I even remember my mom seeming mad at me, which makes no sense to me as an adult. I&#39;m 34 now, and only over the last five years or so have I worked up the courage to try new seafoods that are actually well prepared. I even love sushi now, but for years, I was afraid to try it, thinking I might gag.
Diet soft drink are yucky, aspartame is very toxic and dangerous,  it causes cancer and eats holes in your brain
It might be cool to see a video where Tati goes through each skin care claim and why we want those products removed from our products (ie sulfate free, why don’t we want sulfate in products). Just a thought but love these new kind of video,  very informative!
Eat a fruit and you’ll be fine ❤
When it comes to inauthenticity I don&#39;t know where you&#39;d start with Heather Mills.
if they kill bond its close case for james bond movies 007 is dead you kill the character no more movies if they make the next with the black woman its going to be a bud light moment game over go woke go broke crash an burn shame because i really liked james bond its a british thing i guess you get any one else play the part then its not james bond anymore its james broken
I loved this show deep into my struggle with anorexia... I was so jealous that the people got to look at the food tube thing to see how little they were eating...
🤢.<br>I&#39;m glad I stopped eating that shit years n&#39; years ago!<br>When I was young I could eat a ton of it.<br>Now in my 40&#39;s I feel sick when I eat even a little of it.<br>It&#39;s pure 💩.
The second fast food kid is fat because both her parents are fat.
DC was the worst Bond for me, so I felt it hard to dredge up any emotion for him as the missiles came over. His expression reminded me of those turtle head characters, can&#39;t recall their name. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the Bond girl either - she seemed weak, acting was fairly wooden, didn&#39;t feel any chemistry between her and Bond, Vesper was much more attractive and engaging. Even though we watched this in the theatre, I was bored. The doctor character was annoying, as you say, the plot holes ruined the story line, we normally need to suspend disbelief in these movies, and get swept along with the action, but when one is thinking to yourself, what the heck just happened, it mars the continuity. Overcoming the nanobots was never explored, what was the point of the watch?
🧡🖤 I STILL HAVE MY PALETTE BUT I DON&#39;T USE IT AS MUCH BECAUSE I DON&#39;T WANT TO RUN OUT I&#39;VE ALREADY HIT PAN ON JUST A FEW COLORS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND I HOPE YOU CAN COME OUT WITH SOME MORE PELLETS IN THE FUTURE I HOLD ON TO MINE LIKE IT&#39;S GLASS AND FRAGILE I DON&#39;T WANT ANYTHING HAPPENING TO IT NO DUPE IS GOING TO RECREATE THIS MASTERPIECE YOU HAVE 🖤🧡
It was a great pallet!! It’s one of my favorites 💕💕
Very interesting to see a wh*te woman wag her finger at these beautiful strong bipoc kings and queens. Fat shaming is very much alive, and this “documentary” proves it.
This video was just interrupted by that tool who says carbs and donuts don’t make you fat. Weird.
Why would I want to eat poison masquerading as food?
Excellent clip! You managed to pack in (or perhaps A &amp; F did) more cringe than I thought possible in a non true crime video. Great channel by the way!
58 looks like 78 😢😢 overweight so bad
If somebody loses weight on this crazy diet, they certainly will lose water and muscles
Must be nice to be so care free, meanwhile I&#39;m sitting here worrying about how I&#39;m paying all my bills and eat while working just a full time job
You’re one of my comfort YouTubers so I keep rewatching these videos over time. I didn’t realize it the first time watching, but now I can see that it’s so obvious that something similar was going on with my ex best friend and me. The way Tammy speaks reminds me so much of her suddenly and especially the way she speaks about Amy is kinda similar to how this „friend“ spoke about me. <br>In my case it wasn’t about weight loss but about psychological issues and how one handles their trauma. It always kinda felt like a competition, like who had the worst trauma, who was the bigger victim… she openly told me she was jealous of me many times and also how my trauma must not have been as bad as hers or else I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish the things I have. (Which, I don’t have an amazing life with tons of accomplishments. I struggle with depression and everyday is a fight for survival sometimes, but I’m not gonna give up on life and work really hard to maintain a somewhat hopeful mindset and I’m really grateful to still be here) she always blamed someone or something else for her failures, even when it was absolutely clear, that sometimes it was just the consequences of her behavior and she felt entitled to everything cause she had it so hard and everyone was out to get her, supposedly. It really hurt, seeing my friend so unhappy and I was trying everything to be supportive but I struggle with my own issues and have a limited capacity. When I told her this, she completely exploded and to this day is convinced that I am/was actively trying to sabotage her.<br>But somehow it makes sense now why she is that way. Im glad to have herbeizubringende my life but I don’t hate her and I really wish her all the best and hopefully one day she will be able to self reflect about her behavior and create a happier life for herself.
No need for scientific reasons. Water is fluid,which makes your body and brain more fluid. Its that simple. So drink all you can all day everyday.
I personally know three people that’s had this surgery, sadly after a few years all three gained the weight back.
anorexia nervosa is one of the most evil conditions that there is.  This woman&#39;s crass hijacking of the disease is disgusting.  She is disgusting (inside and out)
You&#39;re putting things way too kindly Ben. Everybody pays not only their fair share to the great leviathan, but much more than that. The government extorts people&#39;s money and spend it in whatever the fuck they want, they&#39;re only held (barely) accountable every 4 years.
Ok, OK, ok °^° HE LOOKS GREAT WITHOUT EYEBROWS <br>Holy moly wooo crazy
What a brilliant mind, you can make america great.. I would vote for you, no second thoughts, and im not even an american
I hope you would make video on intermittent fasting in the future and it&#39;s benefits in loosing weight
I&#39;m 14 years old and trying to loose weight so I can fit into some clothes I have and I&#39;m trying to achieve a slimmer body for the asthetic. I&#39;m 9 stone and 12 lbs. I really appreciate you and this channel, it&#39;s helped a lot.
I’m sorry if someone already said this… I love PTR products, but you have to use very specific makeup with it. Angie Hot and Flashy did a great review on the product and what to avoid. Take care!
you can buy all those brushes from elf for like 50-75$. And theyre great quality.
Recreate this look with your favorites!!!!
No more animal fats.
Living with diabetes can trigger more eating and super high blood sugar levels 😮her sugars are probably 450 up
The mistakes you make you could just make them out of a creation
It would be great if you did a second one same but higher end, I loved this idea.
The petite botany scully kneel because court anaerobically haunt underneath a embarrassed chef. busy, bloody chive
So I work in food service. In a franchise that specializes in sugary soft serve treats. Yes the manufacturers are participating in shrinkflation. But, we’ve had a sugar shortage. We’ve had unions strike in plants that make these treats. So it’s well beyond just corporate greed. I have not been able to get candy toppings here and there since the middle of last year. There are many factors here that actually make it so the corporations can profit. And the smarties package. You can tell they unwrapped, took a few out, then rewrapped. Please be careful with what’s used to show the problem.
I also changed up my diet and eating habits in February this year. I had been gaining and getting to the fattest point in my life (relatively fat, my BMI was just on the lower end of Overweight). I started intermittent fasting and doing strength resistance exercises 15 min a day before breakfast. Lost 20lbs so far and it&#39;s steady now. My clothes are getting looser still even though the number on the scale hasn&#39;t really changed 😊 My pants size has gone from &quot;not fitting into 32&quot; to &quot;easily fitting into 28.&quot; It&#39;s all about routine and perseverance. No miracle cure for most people without certain medical problems like thyroid or whatever
He gave himself a real eating disorder. He ded
Caught that sweatshirt 💪💪 amen
I have loved you before but I often thought that you don&#39;t look all that happy. I don&#39;t know I felt like all the makeup and people and PR and the amount of work, you were desperately trying to fill up a hole and you cared so much about what others thought, even people who absolutely weren&#39;t worth it.<br><br>Now when I watch you I sense that you&#39;re having fun and that makes watching your videos much more chill and I&#39;m so glad to see you grow and live your life for you and for others but still share it with us.<br><br>Somehow when you share the real you with us, it feels so much more precious than when you were putting up a show. It was great, too, but one could really see the built up stress right under the surface.
I agree you can do what you want with your body as long as you do not harm or kill someone else. I can choose to swing my arm around but if assault someone with it. It is wrong. The very act of abortion is to harm and kill someone else. Another body. The abortion allows someone to refuse responsibility for their choices.
Anna Richardson has done some interesting shows with educational content, like this and Secret Eaters. Even Naked Attraction, as silly as the premise of the show is, has some fun facts sprinkled in here and there. It&#39;s good to see her presenting a show with a more serious tone (even if it was from before Naked Attraction, which was my introduction to her)
the fact that half the comments are in what i think is finnish, is just, great
People who leave mean comments need to look in the mirror and ask themselves why it bothers them so much what other people do with THEIR body 🤔 People NEED to chill out and stop judging others
Is that why you fired Candice Owens? Bible verses about peace is too much diversity for you? What is it you say?…Facts don’t care about your feelings? Educate yourself first on Israel’s complicity on both creating and funding Hamas to purposely sew division among the Palestinians… I’m not condoning the atrocities that were committed heinous as the were but for Israel to then commit the same acts of genocide ….well doesn’t that leave the whole world blind?
People confuse the traits of a narcissist way too often with the traits of BPD or with plain old overcorrection of extremely low confidence.<br>She hates herself. When she says she’s great and all, all she’s doing is trying to convince herself. You can tell she doesn’t like herself at all. In fact, she dislikes herself so much that she’s already confident beforehand that she’ll fail at losing weight.
Jeffree you look great with eyebrows. Without, you look like you are sick with Cancer. It really makes you look unhealthy. As always, you make me laugh so hard. You&#39;re like a bad addiction, but in a good way. You make me feel like I&#39;m a kid playing with toys. I live for these moments.
I’m confused. Didn’t Google make their employees fat in the first place? Then they changed things so the employees just lost the weight that Google caused them to gain?
I was 185 lbs. My aim is to reduce my weight to 154 lbs. I am currently at 170 lbs and it&#39;s becoming really hard for me to lose further weight even after eating less calories per day
I am a med student and we study so much about how obesity is a risk factor for numerous diseases, focusing on mechanisms of how being obese specifically affect different organ system. I cannot fathom how this person is a doctor and still chose to overlook all that researched information?
I&#39;m gonna be so honest, seeing fat babies really pisses me off. Like these parents don&#39;t give a literal fuck about their babies. These kids haven&#39;t had a choice
You wanna talk about chair issues, try being left handed and sitting in those school chair-desk combos made for right handed people. The amount of times I tried to stand up by getting out on the left side, and then biffing it in front of the class 😂 I&#39;m overweight, mainly due to my own admitted laziness, and I don&#39;t fit into the chairs at my dentist. I just laugh and say my fat ass doesn&#39;t fit in their chair, so give me a moment while I try think skinny lol It&#39;s gonna be ok. I&#39;m gonna be ok if I don&#39;t fit in the chair or if a desk is the wrong way for me. There are bigger problems to worry about in life that need legitimate attention. 🤦‍♀️
Boy that make-up gloss that stops you from eating is the BEST idea I ever heard on shark tank! 🦈 I would back her company for FREE and just give her the money she needs.
6I&#39;m now wondering if I&#39;m using the wrong brush- Because I have that same cream-to-powder blush and I CANNOT get it on my brush without  REALLY getting my brush in there and swirling it around. My brush has a really hard time picking it up for some reason<br>Also I would rather have teeny brows like her than have my GIANT blocky thick brows LMAOO
Again I don’t think it’s a skinny world I think Hollywood ski place but you guys are normal every day women I don’t understand why this is so crazy but I think it would be hard being in Hollywood and being my size which is a size 8/10
The best things that work for me are:<br>Have a good breakfast (I try to eat healthy but quite sweet breakfast such as oatmeal with nuts and fruits or an oat-banana pancake with homemade peanut butter. That keeps cravings away)<br>Lunch with a green salad as first course <br>Very light dinner such as cooked veggies or papaya and yogurt<br>And mostly: AVOID EATING BETWEEN MEALS. If I have even an innocent treat, it could trigger binge eating. So I don&#39;t do it anymore.
Where did you get your sweater?
There is nothing attractive about fat.
im watching The Critical Drinker since he started on youtube...great guy
Ashley looks like she has lost a lot of weight
I know respect opossums becuse they eat a crazy amount of ticks every year
Ur fukin AWESOME 👏 ❤ LOVE UR REALNESS N U DO A GREAT VID ON MAKE UP U LOOK FABULOUS❤
I know three people who need to go to fat camp and two of them are my best friend 🗿
Has Ben ever ran for any political office. His views match my own he&#39;s definitely very intelligent and would greatly serve our country
I will say i do usually prefer that they use actors and actresses that accurately represent the roles they are playing (white actresses playing white queens and vice versa etc) but the actress who played queen Charlotte in the netflix series was absolutely phenomenal and it was a great show. Also, the whole show is only about 60-70% historical accurate anyway, due to embellishments and the such to mock it up to a theatrical form
Color stay Foundation 🙌⬇️🔥🔥Now the formula depends on you. I have dry skin all year around and I can use both formulas (Summertime I sweat… so that’s my Sweatproof Summer Foundation) <br><br>Physicians Formula lip glosses is really.. About the price. If you can afford it get it. It’s pretty much Mehh ( pigment, hydrating, lasting ) BUT WHAT CHEAPER LIP GLOSS CANT DO THAT. <br><br>I love the face and eyes Tati

Good Job!  The movie was terrific and soooooo needed  for America. I would bet the Death Star run idea came from the canyon flying the military does. The military has been doing low level  canyon training for 50 years plus, some of it through the hills around the L.A. basin.
OH MY GOD!!!! EVERY TIME I SEE THESE COMMENTS  I ALWAYS SEE THAT HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO LOOKS GREAT WITHOUT EYEBROWS!!! YES, HE /SHE DOES LOOK GOOD. FUCK!!!!!
Another great video! We appreciate all the time and effort you put into your videos
Hey, I’m a 32 year old guy and I check my backseat when I get in. Some people just wanna do bad things to whoever
It doesn&#39;t help that many fast food chains have taken anything that was even remotely healthy off of their menus. Why is grilled chicken no longer a choice? It is only fried! I actually prefer grilled. I also do actually like eating salads but those are also gone from many menus. Not offering healthier options should not be ok! Especially when they used to! It really pisses me off.
such a great interview!!! love both of your voices
As a Canadian, 2hrs is short... you drive 10hrs for something and it&#39;s great cus you can make it back in the same day 😭
10 days for the Premiere from the Album: &quot;Treat Myself&quot;👍❤<br>Meghan trainor 😍
This is the definition of disgusting
I am sure that the BP movement was more about disfigurement, differences and disabilities when it first came about. The obese co opted it and then complain and cut people out. Mental
So much support for Taiwan was passed over. Being a key democratic country in the first island chain, plus Japan, South Korea, the Uk, Canada, India, Australia and others all opposing the taking of Taiwan. The Quad...That&#39;s a lot of support. How much support does China have? Allies? They have 17 to 19 border disputes and lose to one, India, every time. China is not a dragon. It&#39;s a peacock.
Love him or hate him this guy has an amazing eye for seeing great talents and managing them well!!
This is so disgusting to watch they call Jesus non binary, Jesus is gay... In muslims we believe Jesus also called as Isaa alaihasalam is Allah&#39;s Prophet , we being a muslim never ever make fun of him and these people are derange ... This is Sad !!!
Research History? This has all been done before. History REPEATS itself.
Try applying the same foods for vegans or vegetarians by removing all the meats, like the beef, fish or chicken.
white rice is not junk food. It&#39;s the healthiest food and eaten by all Asians who are slimmer than White people.
Ashley is a wonderful host! So natural and no phony stupid questions. Like a real person having a real conversation! I have to be honest. I did not care for Christian on PR. Just was not my thing and he was young and way too full of himself. HOWEVER, as he has matured and his inclusion of all women of all shapes, sizes, colors etc. has won my heart. I now look at other collections and ask why aren&#39;t they doing what Christian just did??!!
Sugar, carbs, Sodium - that leads to obesity...I eat mostly bell peppers, onions, cucumbers, mushrooms, apples, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, drink water and coffee black. Thinner in my late 40s than my early 20s when I ate garbage. It&#39;s all diet and exercise. How much do you think a meal like that costs? Less than $5 a day.
Fat. Overweight people mock people for every thing but calling an obese person fat is mean and ugly but they call us the skinny chick or beautiful chick and I  say  fat chick I&#39;m  even considered racist against unhealthy obesity
I used to be a fat person. I was about 330 pounds.<br><br>I got tired of being sick, so I got serious about it and three years ago start losing weight <br><br>Today I’m 220 pounds and when I tell you, it’s a world of difference I mean it’s a freaking world of difference <br><br>I would never hate on fat people because I understand what they’re going through but it is a choice and they need to understand. Some people are making a better choice than them and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Great is greener on the other side
Great video tati
i feel like i start binge eating when my parents out of home or when i am far from them. I dont know why exactly
I lost 40 pounds in two weeks. it&#39;s simple cut your food intake down. I ate two meals a day, meat, salads and exercise.
I use to get jack in the box once a week, same thing, love it, like 10 years straight. No weeks off. Did a diet, lost a bunch of weight. Went on a road trip and stopped to get that same meal. It was about noon. Hadn’t had it in like 7 months. Got on the road about 30 minutes later, I felt like I was gonna fall asleep. The crash was always scary. Don’t think I’ve had that meal since, maybe 9 years ago. 😊
anyone think the oc creator was being sarcastic, perhaps 🤔
Great Stuff
This is one of the most eye-opening and impactful videos I&#39;ve ever seen - I think its so easy to give in to quick calorie foods but recognising the incredible value of low calorie to high nutrition ratio foods in improving all aspects of your health (strength, immune system, brain function, etc) and literally extending your lifespan completely changes how I think of food now. Thank you so much Kiana for creating these amazingly informative and brilliantly designed videos!
I just bought the whole painted set and I love it! I’ve created some awesome looks with it, and the formula is PERFECT💗
Such hideous people......disgusting
I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m constantly surprised when people fall for stuff like this.  Just the headline alone would cause me to scroll right past it knowing there would be no actual benefit to it yet people not only buy the book but advertise it on national television as this &quot;miracle diet&quot; as a cash grab.  This book still has 4 stars on amazon over almost 800 reviews so the overwhelming majority still recommend this book.  Why people would rather buy into this rather than look into actual scientific data for weight loss is beyond me.
It just blows my mind how so-called “professional” individuals were actually okay with threatened violence
The poorest ppl  in America are the fattest. No one is starving here!
I love how honest they are!! <br>I do think being yourself as much as possible is the most important thing...as there is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution. <br>Love - Gratitude and Never Giving Up are super important.<br>Thank you both!
If they enjoy eating these weird ass things, it&#39;s more like oral fixation and stimulation that gives them pleasure.
On the other side, you have youtubers who, just by mere curiosity, go 3+ days without eating and say they feel better than ever. Humans are such strange creatures.
As a 14 year old girl that lost 20kg (from 80-60) in the last 4,5 months I find your videos could be very helpfull. I sadly found your channel after I already got my stuff together. It started because I was doing research and a project on personality, that helped me become more open minded and started analyzing my behavior- I found out that my over eating stemmed from the fact that I was just sad,bored and playing video games all day. Luckily this “enlightening “ happened just before summer break so I could put my full effort into loosing weight. I first started with getting myself busy and being productive ( I personally feel a lot happier and emotionally “satiated” when I’ve had a productive day and can go exhausted to bed) so I was helping my dad construct our house all the time except when I had to eat (switched my old stuff for low calorie high volume food ) and also I started playing tennis every other day so I had 700-900 active calories daily. When school started it first didn’t really impact me, just switched out construction work to studying more (sadly my active calories dropped😢) but I’ve recently had a little bump in the road- I got sick, so no tennis but this was still ok cause I was putting all my energy this week into a biology seminar, next week I went to school but still no tennis but still working on seminar but I started eating really poorly for like 3 weeks and gained 2 kg, but I got it under control and already lost those 2kg back. Also I started going to the gym with my friend half a week ago ( i think it’s gonna substitute tennis because it’s getting cold and tennis is really expensive tbh and I don’t think I can suport tennis, gym and getting good grades and placing in competitions )
Nothing easier than a simple leg death lift, butw this whale is sweating 😂😂
Tbh my fave places to hand out stuff on Halloween-- if not full size candies-- were the ones giving out stupid little toys and pencils and shit like that. Anything Halloween themed has been a fave growing up so it gave me a spooky toy or usable thing for year &#39;round!
I haven&#39;t been your size since I was 12. <br>Her at 12... 375lbs.....
I don&#39;t  know if you need to hear this<br>But you beautiful girl <br>You deserve greatness. <br>Just saying
If simple carbohydrates are not very good for a diet, does anyone know if fats like butter, milk, cheese are okay in moderation? Or would it be best to avoid them as well?
Love Sophia! Such a classy, intelligent, beautiful role model. Ashley is also a such great interviewer, she genuinely listens to the guests which most don’t!
GoD Is GoOD GoD Is gREaT
Does the baby has any health risks while developing in such fat woman?
The funny thing is, his mindset was probably programmed into him by a previous (or current) wh*re girlfriend a who wants to cheat all the time without consequences. Thus, he’s a beta male.
The funny thing is that the one guy tried to call out, Ben&#39;s hypocrisy while showing his own Hypocrisy.   Lol. If everyone has the right to feel &quot;comfortable in their own skin&quot;... Why do these women athletes not have the right to have their own private bathrooms and openly speak about it without being considered transphobic?  Or just women&#39;s bathrooms in general like at gyms and spas... If it&#39;s a free country, why are we denying the rights of women? We are basically treating them like they don&#39;t matter.  Seems like instead of saying &quot;trans rights are human rights&quot;.... We need to be saying &quot;women&#39;s rights are human rights.&quot;
I CANNOT with the nails-anything in public!! I work in an office and i can hear my boss clipping his nails in his office next to me and then i hear my mom (she works with me) in her cubicle filing hers and it sounds like someone is sanding wood to me. My father in law carries little clippers in his pocket and pulls them out and trims away like sitting on our couch or standing in the kitchen and i just have to leave the room and clean extra later (my in laws are otherwise super lovely so i bite my tongue on this). 😳🙈🙉🤢
The beatboxing❤️🔥
She is a disgusting human being! Activists like this should never hold office!
The whole family needs to go on a diet.   They&#39;re all obese and the sad part is they&#39;re calling each other out on their weight.   I can&#39;t
I&#39;ve lost 90 lbs and I feel so much better but right now I&#39;m struggling to lose the last 10 and wanting to eat for emotional comfort. I just want to eat and feel better, not feel so sad and angry. Eating was how I coped and as life has become out of control recently I&#39;m struggling with finding a coping strategy that works for me. But I&#39;m not giving up, I&#39;m going to lose that 10 lbs and hit my goal weight of 140.
It was great seeing your mom.
I just started, im one day behind. I must say that your commentary and your attitude made me soooo happy. I wasnt having a bad day, not good either. I’m just happy I am doing this with you. I have been wanting to get out of this cycle of just eating and eating and eating and you really brighten up my day. It’s been hard to do some exercises since I have a really bad back (sciatica nerve damage) but i truly love this idea of doing this challenge with you!!!! I love my cuuuuurves and good luck to everyone doing this challenge! I’m 280lbs, if I can do it and have fun, you can too!!!! 💓💓💓❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈
NH is an absolute NO. She went establishment clearly however it matters not. Please America, please do not ever elect an female president. I think it’s been proven over the last couple decades that women do not have what it takes. Sorry ladies. Any woman as a U.S. president would have a huge target on her back. Not from American citizens, from other countries. Most foreign leaders would never ever respect her. We need male strength, and a whole lot of it.<br>DT will not back down unless there is a strong worthy candidate on the ballot. In my opinion, he doesn’t want to keep this up unless he has to. <br>Trump should never see a day in prison however, the desperation is heating up. People really have gone to prison committing what could be called a crime with no victims. If nothing else, the establishment will simply make it happen. They want him gone and they will succeed. They really are that evil. Again, proven over the last few decades.<br>Maybe we the people should save ourselves.
Who&#39;s toasting their poptarts every time they eat them??? That shit takes TIME!
I love your videos. I had NO idea you lost so much weight. You’re stunning!
This is making me want to eat ramen right now and I don&#39;t have any :( 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I’m sorry but on some level I have to believe that these people are actually stupid like the access to information Nowadays is ridiculous you know what you’re doing you’re just lying to yourself and you’re dumb for getting on a TV show and doing that. I just don’t understand that. How can you on one hand say I don’t eat sweets or anything like that I don’t have sugar but then on the other hand slamming large cokes, chocolate bars, and everything else with your fast food meals
If Ben had responded to the threat with &quot;That&#39;s not very ladylike behavior&quot;, things probably would have gotten violent from there.
I&#39;m tryin&#39; to hold my breath<br>Let it stay this way<br>Can&#39;t let this moment end<br>You set off a dream in me<br>Gettin&#39; louder now<br>Can you hear it echoing?<br>Take my hand<br>Will you share this with me?<br>&#39;Cause darling without you<br><br>All the shine of a thousand spotlights<br>All the stars we steal from the night sky<br>Will never be enough<br>Never be enough<br>Towers of gold are still too little<br>These hands could hold the world but it&#39;ll<br>Never be enough<br>Never be enough<br><br>For me<br>Never, never<br>Never, never<br>Never, for me<br>For me<br>Never enough<br>Never enough<br>Never enough<br>For me<br>For me<br>For me<br><br>All the shine of a thousand spotlights<br>All the stars we steal from the night sky<br>Will never be enough<br>Never be enough<br>Towers of gold are still too little<br>These hands could hold the world but it&#39;ll<br>Never be enough<br>Never be enough<br><br>For me<br>Never, never<br>Never, never<br>Never, for me<br>For me<br>Never enough<br>Never, never<br>Never enough<br>Never, never<br>Never enough<br>For me<br>For me<br>For me<br><br>For me
My controlled eating stems from my dissatisfaction with my body, but assuming that&#39;s everyone&#39;s justification is ridiculous. Controlling how much you eat is beneficial (unless you eat too much or too little)!
man commits murder: <b>life sentence or death</b><br>woman commits murder: <b>20 years out in 10 for parole</b><br><br>family court: man will give almost everything he has to the woman, she gets the kids, 50% of his income as alimony + another 30% for child support he can go live in a card board box, or go to prison if he don&#39;t pay.  also no he cannot see the kids unless the woman says he can.<br><br>woman makes false accusation against a man: everyone &quot;beat him to death or throw him in prison for life&quot;   he proves innocence: oh he scared her into recanting he totally still guilty black list him and make him a pariah.<br><br>man gets abused by woman, man gets arrested and banned from the home he pays for even if she does not live there and was just visiting.<br><br>ya men are for oppressed these days we literally cannot win no matter what we do anymore.
Preach sista Gabrielle!!! Another great interview Ashley.
Dang, regular men were eating bodybuilder off season bulking amounts of food 😅
They can be positive about their body, but they&#39;ll still die young from the many diseases they have from just being fat.
Great video Tati, thank you. However can&#39;t find the drugstore makeup in the description.
Would love to see what drug abuse deaths add to the drop in life expectancy.
Get off your pedestal, white people eat processed foods too, don&#39;t ever underestimate the power of big food, all of America is getting fat
I love his love for plus women! I pray for a designer dress from him one day. Dreams!
The alert fairies italy shiver because badge paradoxically bang plus a thoughtless dorothy. penitent, jumbled gosling
Betas need not breed
We do need each other. All people are born from women. Women raise and preserve our children (or should) women take what men create and turn it beautiful. They turn houses into homes.
Locking the doors and checking the back seat as a white girl thing 😂
It ISN&#39;T THE FAST FOOD, it&#39;s the people that eat too much of it. I haven&#39;t eaten fast food in about 20 years but I still like the thought of it but I know it won&#39;t be good for me so I just don&#39;t eat it. You can eat anything you want to eat, the key is THE QUANTITY and HOW OFTEN YOU EAT IT. These people have NO limits and eat all day long.
She is an Amazing person very crazy that she lost so much weight .
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he ends up marrying a woman with all these features...😂
Help lol I have not tried anything I was 21 walked into MAC and they colored matched my foundation I felt like a princess lol MAC studio sculpt spf foundation NC30 I think, but I feels heavy on me like if I need to put on a whole face of makeup then I use it. Also they pared it with medium plus mineralize I was 21 then and I’m 35 sad I need help I want something that makes me feel fresh easy on the coverage
im glad ur not fat anymore cuz u have like the 10/10 face, literally
Oh my goodness, Kiana! I’ve never seen a picture of you from your overweight days. I’ve been watching your channel for a good 7/8 months now and am very familiar with your story but wow! You looked so adorable😊 So young too🥹 Anyway, all the best! Xx
Sexy fat breast
I would like to know why my sister is still hella fat and she’s on ozempic prescribed from her doctor lol
I think that it is super just heartening that a size 6 or a size 10 or even a size 14 is considered big I can understand when obesity is into effect but liking to eat mac &amp; cheese once in a while and not having to watch every single thing that is in your body is in powering and Most women are at least a size 6 if not larger only Hollywood makes it normal to be a size 2.
I&#39;m watching many scooter Braun videos because I want to get famous, like ariana and justin, btw I think scooter is a great, nice and hard working manager
Everybody needs to get backyard chickens. Mine love to eat ticks :)
Truly though, body weight or fat is really not proportional to what people eat, or even how much they &quot;exercise&quot;. And deprivation always leads to metabolism deregulation and lots of problems anyway. If you line 10 people up and try to guess which ones eat what you&#39;ll find it is only out of luck that you can guess anyone.
Love this type of content!! I’m loving the Mac eyeshadow palette as well!! I’ll always be a wedge girl!! Great video!
Don&#39;t eat sushi. People who do are riddled with parasites.
idgaf what you&#39;re eating  EATING LESS MAKES YOU LOSE WEIGHT. These uneducated fucks dont understand basic calorie deficit
I have a strained relationship with my father and I often wish he was gone. I have so much anxiety knowing he is here and that I can&#39;t bring myself to speak to him. His life has been sad and pathetic(his own doing) and it would be mercy for it to be over. He causes everyone so much pain and says he will not apologize for anything he&#39;s done. I feel like I cant move on or heal while he is alive. He wants me and my siblings to just forget everything thats been said and done. It really pains me that he is alone, but he did it to himself.
Why did James eat it
Sorry but making someone associate an addiction or substance with something gross or unpleasant IS a real type of treatment that has been used for decades and for many it is effective.
Yes but primarily the lone star tick because of the meat allergy
it can be usefull  that the hole brush  set is light weight   and its looks flexable .
Hmmmm. Ronald Reagan destroyed over 40 years of economic growth and tax strategy. Eisenhower had a great <a href="http://strategy.tax/">strategy.TAX</a> HIGH to businesses and to defer those rates they paid the worker more and their benefits and a pension for retirement. so they were in a lower tax &quot;group&quot; Giving your employees more money and benefits. Lowered the burden. Now businesses take advantage of slave labor. The world laughs at America 😂 America is in the 2nd Gilded age of development smfh
Tati, I’m so glad to see your face on YT again. I was hesitant to watch bc my wallet is gonna take the hit. 🤣🤣🤣as always great recommendations and I’m glad your back!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m living for that sweater
I&#39;ve been struggling this past week because I just got a sleeve gastrectomy last Wednesday. I&#39;m having trouble emotionally adjusting to the change and wishing I had the ability to eat to cope like I used to. I&#39;ve been watching Megan Anne&#39;s and your videos since one of Megan&#39;s randomly got suggested to me. I was scared of watching it at first, believing it was going to be making fun of obesity or making light of the struggle. You and Megan have handled this issue with such care and grace that it was easy to subscribe to both of you. I realized pretty quickly I had been in Megan&#39;s similar position with the fat acceptance movement creating a loop of self-sabotage disguised as self-care. A year ago, I was close to 600 pounds. As of yesterday, I&#39;m at the 480-something mark and I&#39;m just getting started. Megan said something in her 315-pound life video that really hit home with me. She said she would have to talk to her therapist about how she treated her body so badly for all those years. I realized I need to explore this topic too. I treated my body badly because emotionally, I didn&#39;t feel worth being treated any better. Now that I love who I am on the inside and am incredibly grateful to my body for not giving up on me, I&#39;m using yours and Megan&#39;s videos to reaffirm I&#39;m making the right choices (and the truly courageous ones) in facing my fears, addictions, and insecurities to have a better quality of life. I deserve it. If you&#39;re reading this, you deserve to be here. &lt;3
You did amazing in guessing everyone sizes! 👏😆
Tess Holliday is THE LAST PERSON TO TELL ANYONE about eating properly!!! Is she srsly trying to make ppl give her credit as some1 who knows what is and is not healthy?????😳😳😳
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcSmq18VcDU&amp;t=11m27s">11:27</a> My wife and I go to see my mother-in-law every other weekend... <br>The breakfast consists of bacon, egg, sausage, bread and (sweetened) apple juice... and then on top of that there&#39;s a pile of food for lunch and dinner AND of course sweets and pie. It was not unusual for me to gain 5 to 6 pounds in ONE weekend on that diet. Now I am VERY careful about limiting my portion sizes on these weekend visits and it has helped control my weight.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
Can I try to recreate this look ? And tag you ? Please
She eats only salad..with 9 pounds of dressing.
Very great video its was can opener cuz much people dosenst se before 200 years ago =) Thank you Kiana from smart Canada =)
Eating fresh Vegetables Is good for you
Great interview. Dapper Dan is such an intriguing, talented, and learned guy. So happy for his success.
That look is so bad, it&#39;s MY worst makeup day. Seriously, Tati - What were you thinking? Orangey, goopy mess along the jawline, Great Wall of China shine (you can see it from outer space!)...Ok, enough! If I watch more, I&#39;ll be influenced the wrong way! Love you anyway, see you next time! 😅
This video was foreshadowing to Kylie&#39;s dollar tree vegan leather brushes.
I got Johnny beat, humbly😵
The Eyeshadow one with the tissue is actually one that I&#39;ve done before 👍<br>Great hack 👍<br>And James approved apparently 👍
The stories of the rape gangs in English cities is unreal, I won’t and don’t need to name and shame the groups involved but it’s absolutely disgusting!
I have Eczema on my eyes and face sometimes when I do my makeup it’s looks so dry that sometimes I can’t even wear makeup without it looking so dry and gross
20% pregnancy related death huh?<br><br>There is a death 100% of the time for abortions.
I&#39;ve fibromyalgia, during lockdown I started doing workouts, planks easy stuff 15mins then ended up doing like 4 15min workouts everyday for 2 years I slimmed down quite a bit was like 13stone to 10, my muscles went all lumpy my arms my abdomen all hard lumps never went away all this time, I&#39;ve tried so many meds now on pregablin works so well thank god finally I was wanting to die now I&#39;ve hope no panic attacks maybe that&#39;s cause I did mushrooms and saw there is no heaven or hell I was obsessed with hell we are all God or source code not sure yet but I don&#39;t get panic attacks or fear death anymore and that&#39;s a huge deal I was obsessed with thatbfor so long, anyways my muscles are still lumpy, it&#39;s definitely fascia related
I absolutely FEEL the multiple alarms thing 😅 in my case it&#39;s an ADHD thing, I struggle really hard with getting up in the morning and I&#39;ve also come to realize, that I&#39;m more of a &quot;nightowl&quot;. I think a lot of us are but our lives/jobs do not allow this. I feel way more creative and motivated at night, when everything and everyone is silent and I don&#39;t have as many distractions and expectations to fullfill.<br>Sometimes a &quot;bad habit&quot; is who we are but society doesn&#39;t accept this way of living.<br>Nevertheless, I hope you&#39;re successful in breaking this cycle for yourself. 😊❤
I let my children have fast food once a week as a treat and they were never allowed soda milk or water or nothing at all.
fat fuck: being fat is hard :( i can&#39;t move, i have diabetes, i can&#39;t walk T_T its so haaaaaard....*cries*<br>also the fat fuck: THE 60 BOXES OF PIZZAS IS NOT ENOUGH I NEED MORE FOOD!
Redcoats.... &quot;Don&#39;t do that on a first  date&quot; well to me that sounds like a great first date tbh 🤷‍♂️

&quot;Trying being my size Amy&quot;<br><br>She was tho
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
Im a bit overweight and so i stopped eating all but maybe 300 to 500 calories a day and worked out 4 to 5x a week and could not lose 1 single pound. It wasnt till i started eating properly that i started losing weight.
Finneas, (Billie&#39;s brother), is actually a great guy with beautiful, amazing music. I appreciate that his Halloween costume here was less disgusting than most of these other weirdos.
Nathan looks great just like jeffree said but he always does the mask didnt do anything .<br> I miss them on youtube but im glad jeffree is happy and nathan to..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4FCoMsLr_s&amp;t=12m05s">12:05</a> To say it&#39;s not at all about willpower, but rather strategy or something else, isn&#39;t true. You&#39;re normally rational, but as is commonly the case, when people get blinded by commercialism (e.g. selling a product, in this case your program) their objectivity and respect for the truth become compromised. Plus their wording becomes less precise and filled with absolutes.<br><br>People can easily control the elephant. For example, stop eating, m@sturbating (nofap) etc. using willpower alone. For example, I was addicted to sugar, especially soda, but started having reactive hypoglycemia. it was manageable and I wasn&#39;t yet diabetic, but I gave it up without issue for years. I even store it cold in my fridge for my family and never drink it despite it being visible, cool and easily accessible.<br><br>I&#39;m not bragging. I&#39;m simply pointing out that almost everyone is capable of immediately and permanently ending a lifelong addiction cold turkey using willpower alone, even if the stakes aren&#39;t all that high (e.g. annoying, but manageable, episodes of reactive hypoglycemia). Not reaching for junk food, having binges and so on can easily be done by anyone. By no stretch of the imagination is this comparable to trying to fight a far stronger animal like an elephant. That&#39;s a gross exaggeration and a perfect example of defeatism, the blame game etc.
Really great information in this video.  I&#39;ve watched one of my more mature ladies review the Peter Rothchild&#39;s primer on youtube and  she loved it but used it with a powder foundation.  I&#39;m just never ever gonna wait 7 minutes for something to dry down to apply make up.  I do wait a bit between my skincare and I do that well before my make up routine.  Very interested in trying the RMS....I found that your images did show the differences, especially between the Beauty Blender and RMS where you had the foundation breakdown with the BB on the forehead.  Loved this video!!!!
I lost 40 pounds in two weeks. it&#39;s simple cut your food intake down. I ate two meals a day, meat, salads and exercise.
I have tattoos for people I love. One for my late grandfather, one for my late grandmother, one for my dog who passed away. Oh and one that I actually do regret getting a little 😂 but I plan on covering it up or removing it eventually. And I will be getting two more small tattoos, one for each of my sons.
I love Ashley’s personality.  She doesn’t feel a need to tone down her high energy &amp; I think that makes people around her feel more comfortable.  She’s very affirming and is a great interviewer too.  I’m not famous by any stretch of the imagination but I’d love to be her friend &amp; this seems like a fun podcast!
I used to not eat any veggies, ya know why? because when i tried them, THEIR WAY OF COOKING WAS ALWAYS DISGUSTING when istarted cooking my own vegetables o actually liked how htey tasted cuz it was to my taste pallet,<br>and by the looks of the food she ate, ofcourse she wouldnt-
Fatphobia is reaching us slowly because it&#39;s easily winded.
Gross 😝
I must have a low response, some days i forget to eat and only notice when i get dizzy :I
Im not fat cause i eat unhealthy all the time. Im fat because i will literally EAT EVERYTHING, in High quantities sometimes. It’s hard to calorie control cause im so busy I’ll forget to count what i ate &amp; I’ve tried it a MILLION times, to calorie count or measure food, and i just cant or I’ll forget after a week of doing it, or some shit happens in my life where I lose focus I really  DONT understand portions either. I see images of healthy food in large portions, then I replicate that (using minimal oil- Yes, thats something i do control) and eat it. But still turn out fat at the end because I’ve probably consumed too much ‘healthy’ food. My portion size idea is so distorted and im trying to learn the calories of things and use nutrition references on packaged stuff. It’s hard tho.
Never eat sugar, huh?  Yeah, and I&#39;m 500 lbs., a vegetarian eating plain salads with no dressing, and danced the lead in Swan Lake!    //s
With someone that obese a doctor supervised fast, ala Angus Barbieri, seems to be a viable option. And since they can’t get their own food it would be fairly simple to implement.
ok now hold on.  To lose weight you have to weigh portions and count your calories!  But Marie counting out her almonds is a red flag?  She&#39;s &quot;resisting&quot; because she doesn&#39;t want to eat a sandwich that has an obscene amount of cheese on it?<br><br>She needs help, for sure, but...
This show hit me with the reality stone. It made me realise just how much I was lying to myself, thinking I &#39;didn&#39;t eat enough&#39;. I was eating WAY too much! I started properly calorie counting and I lost 50lbs!
Only the President of the U.S. has a term limit and these old featherless turkeys don&#39;t. This needs to change! Gobble! Gobble!
Ashley looks like she has lost a lot of weight
Painted looks more for theatre , then normal makeup looks
I have loved you before but I often thought that you don&#39;t look all that happy. I don&#39;t know I felt like all the makeup and people and PR and the amount of work, you were desperately trying to fill up a hole and you cared so much about what others thought, even people who absolutely weren&#39;t worth it.<br><br>Now when I watch you I sense that you&#39;re having fun and that makes watching your videos much more chill and I&#39;m so glad to see you grow and live your life for you and for others but still share it with us.<br><br>Somehow when you share the real you with us, it feels so much more precious than when you were putting up a show. It was great, too, but one could really see the built up stress right under the surface.
God forbid children are gonna have fun when they are trying to lose weight
I&#39;ve heard folks say that misgendering someone is &quot;violent speech&quot;, which makes no sense. Here Zoey Tur is ACTUALLY threatening physical violence on someone for what he believes is misgendering.
Due to a digestive disorder I no longer eat fast food, like McDonalds, KFC etc. I actually hate the smell of it. 😊
You are so freaking beautiful realy you are one of most pretty people I&#39;ve ever seen and your videos are well made  it shows how much work you put into your videos. I&#39;m so happy for you bescause of your weightloss jorney you learned so much to get to your goal and I love how inteligent you are and how you constantly want to learn new things, I hope you will not have to struggle with ed nad weight no more and you find healthy middle ground and that you will get to any goal you choose  &lt;3
After eating sugary breakfast for so long I get sick if I eat it in the morning. So while in college I started to make myself different homemade burritos or wraps depending on if I wanted (or had time) to have a warm breakfast. <br><br>It does take time to meal prep which was something I thankfully had but I can see how even my homemade “grab and go” breakfast isn’t an option for everyone. Time is a currency after all.
Yeah my whole life my dad was abusive physically and mentally... but I still... i loved him he was my daddy but at 13 my dad cheated and left and I don&#39;t speak to him and since then I&#39;ve longed for a relationship and luckily rn I have enough self respect to wait for the right guy but I am terrified for the day that I turn to someone who is like my dad and I&#39;m hoping it will never happen but I never learned how to shoot and despite him being a police officer I never knew what it was like to be around a man who would teach me who I should look for😢❤
You are absolutely so real and awesome. Thank you for everything your love for make up your life for your animals your love for the great outdoors. You are entirely my favorite Shirley Katherine in  Phoenix.
Great podcast Ashley!<br>You’re looking amazing 😉 <br>Thank you for making my day ❤️🙏🏼
Anastasia Soare, the creator of ABH, is a Putin admirer, who started the war in Ukraine,  so this brand really needs to cancelled from the beauty world...
After the scenes with the fat girls you look superb in my eveys
For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
Please make a video about secret eating n how to overcome… what steps u took ect … I think am secret eating
I blocked Tik Tok and Instagram from my daughter&#39;s phone.  She survived.  Her friends didn&#39;t sacrifice her to the Peer Presure gods and eat her ceremonially.  She&#39;s fine.  So it&#39;s really a parent problem.  Parents unwilling to do whatever it takes to win that battle.  Up to and including canceling the phone plan for that phone and returning it to the store.  Whatever....it....takes.
They&#39;re all zeroes and men need to start treating them like it. Mean, nasty, unloyal, dirtier living spaces than any bachelor pad I&#39;ve ever seen, spread legs for triple digits, mentally ill, demanding, insane standards, want your money and things, I could go on.<br>The fact that there are millions of simps here and elsewhere giving these b__s your money is beyond me. Stop. Stop giving them anything. No attention, and definitely no money. Stop flooding dms with 💌💌💌😍😍, you look desperate and sad. You&#39;re validating the woman and in the process making a complete fool of yourself. <br>If you want love, save up a few K, go to the islands. You can find hookers or love, whatever floats your boat.
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
Sixty years ago when i was a kid we had sugary cereals, candy, cookies etc.  Yet in my household we had nutritious meals and healthy snacks such as fruit, raw vegetables and dried fruit.  My parents never brought that stuff into the house.  Carbonated beverages were a rare treat, purchased at the Woolworth lunch counter after buying school supplies.  Also unlike school kids today who are mostly bussed to school we walked or rode bikes to school.  At school we had two recesses and gym class a few times a week.  I protested when recesses and gym class were eliminated as cost saving measures as children need to move.  My class growing up had very few chubby kids.  Now obesity and even diabetes are plaguing our kids guaranteeing shorter and sicker lives for our children.  Its time to take control again and saying no to junk food and yes to physically active lives.
The only tattoo I&#39;ll ever get is the tattoo my father got of a traditional Lithuanian crusader to represent our Lithuanian heritage
its ok to fall off the wagon sometimes, it actually can get you to new heights when you eventually get back on track. she should use her friend&#39;s recent success as motivation, especially cuz they are still kind of on the same weight level...
People will do anything to prevent having kids, except refrain from having sex, which is the direct and sole purpose of having sex is procreation.
Loving the workouts! Your so great and positive! 😊
thank you for being such a great role model for us bigger size ladies
Who was that skinny woman doing the sloppy mat routine?! 😂
Great Stuff
Food left alone is just food even if you bring it. But when you eat it turns to fat. No
Hi! I used to watch your channel all the time, but I sort of fell out of watching makeup content. Recently, I&#39;ve been falling in love with your channel all over again! It&#39;s so upbeat, and I can take a second and just think about how fun makeup is! Thanks for all you do, and I hope you never stop posting!
Those breakfast sandwiches sound disgusting
The only foods I can nowadays binge on are homemade foods. <br><br>Homemade fresh bread with raw butter, raw milk, raw cheese, organic meats ❤❤❤ that goes hard
Elaine Welteroth is such a great model of a human!!
i feel sorry for all the pain and drama they are constantly creating for themselves. that attitude is really not working very well for them. it will be a miracle , not impossible, for them to think self-reflectivelyt in this lifetime.  too bad they can&#39;t harness that passion and conviction in a way that works for them.
I treat people with mental illness diagnoses including substance abuse and eating disorders. These “experts” ought to be barred from treating anyone. <br><br>There are MANY therapies that might have worked for her — much better than the stuff they tried. It’s really too bad that she didn’t seek help from competent clinicians.
Now people get shamed for being skinny.everyone is expected to look like a kardashian these days.
1. That was a really annoying video. <br>2. I agree with her, that shouldn&#39;t be considered &quot;fatphobic&quot;.<br>3. Its okay to workout and eat healthier but don&#39;t be like my older sister who eats like an ant and still does exercise every day.
The original comic book captain marvel  was a man.<br>Frankly,<br>if creators think that super hero fans actually want female superheros,<br>then damnit,<br>the least they can do is create something original instead  repackaging an old one with a makeover...
Lol this guy is an actual doctor? OMG. My husband and I are doing carnivore to lose weight. It is alot easier than counting calories and it seems if we eat any carb, mainly fruit we want more sugar. So this diet seems to stop the cravings for sugar.
lol Dr. CLITS? lol <br>I love him. And I think Carnivore is a great elimation diet...there are days where i&#39;m strict carnivore but most days I&#39;m eating whole foods/low carb.
when you lie to people and aren&#39;t honest. You are only cheating yourself
Eveytime I start putting weight back on I watch secret eaters and all of a sudden Im awear of what I ate 💀
Bro he&#39;s asking if he looks good like was there even a question<br>  <br><br><br><br>He can pull anything off<br><br>From a dress to,sweats and oversized sweaters
Great
Ok i didn&#39;t know of Ashley before this but she&#39;s pretty great.
Love all of your new videos! Most influencers don’t do makeup unless they are selling something! Keep up the great work!❤🎉
&quot;about 25 pills a day&quot; I&#39;m on 3 meds + voluntary supplements and think that&#39;s a lot...but I&#39;m also 20 and a healthy weight. I do have a lot of issues with food, especially sugar addiction and binge eating, and if I hadn&#39;t lost about 60 lbs due to anorexia during the pandemic I&#39;d be obese rn. I&#39;m trying to improve, and I&#39;m making baby steps, but it&#39;s so hard... I never give up tho, that&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever done.<br>my pills are for my mental health (depression and adhd), so at least having to take them isn&#39;t a guilty thing, unlike food is for me 😅
Awesome, Dollar Store brushes that I can use for my painting canvas, instead of my face. <br><br>The most of that $380 price is on that cheap pleather chrome fabric she used for the packaging, it&#39;s kind of cheap when buying that fabric- until you get into the packaging and sewing all of that together, then it&#39;s the labor to sew it together. There was PLENTY of cheaper fabrics she could have used for that type of packaging- for instance- 100% cotton plain color, but then that would have required some kind of plastic inserts to keep the cotton solid (like the bill of a hat/cap). <br><br>I&#39;m disappointed - where was the eyeliner brush, the eyebrow brush, and yeah, the lip brush!? Love the fan brush, I use that to paint grasses on my canvas - do a little bit of Bob Ross. Like, I don&#39;t just buy brushes for my face, but if I needed a Dollar Store brush set, I might consider this one. Somebody does it cheaper Kylie- seriously, I don&#39;t think her team is being honest with her. <br><br>But you know, this was 5 years ago.. keep shopping around, each their own.

Children are conditioned into eating certain foods,  there will be some foods a child dislikes but in general, if you give them a balanced diet, they will eat what they are told to.  Fast food is a treat , not a diet.  My children were sent to bed without pudding if they didn’t eat their dinner.  I didn’t fry food, it was either baked, boiled or steamed, for their drink during the meal, it was either apple juice, orange juice or milk otherwise or they could have squash or water.  Trust me when I say, a child will not allow itself to starve if presented with healthy tasty food.  <br>Giving your child fast food as a staple diet, is a cop out by the parent.  You get out what you put in,
Ben Shapiro is actually correct Moreover it&#39;s common sense. Canada is a good example of this. America is not far Behind. But People can believe what they want to believe. Freedom isn&#39;t free. It generally cost. Good luck America Because it&#39;s gonna need it.
Kamala could bore  covid to death!
I can agree with every your point about this but I still think that that beat down argument about being able to make abortion after being pregnant after rape is okay. Yes, you still technically get rid of baby but this is unjust: why would someone need to sacrifice all her life and change every thing in her lifestyle because of some scum?
&quot;she&#39;s like an alien&quot; &quot;she&#39;s masking her true self and showing what she thinks people want to see&quot; &quot;she&#39;s like an AI simulating human behaviour&quot; &quot;she just wants attention&quot; &quot;she&#39;s not behaving like normal people would&quot; &quot;her expressions seem off&quot; Yeah everything about how people describes her just screams female autism + bpd to me. Just the way everyone reacts to her and all the things people pick up on. Someone in the comments even says she illicits, &quot;uncanny valley&quot;. <br> A good therapist having private sessions with each of them and then together sessions passing notes to a judge who orders a restraining order, psychological treatment, and whatever else becomes obvious as needed from the therapist would maybe have been best.
Fat Camp is amazing
Watching this stuff just gave me a stomach ache. People are showing how ignorant and ridiculous they are. What has happened to this countries intelligence?! Just creating pure confusion.
Who needs a movie theater when you have a 75 inch flat screen 4K HDR TV and a very expensive doby atmos surround soundbar? I mean, I&#39;ll never go to another movie theater again till the day I die so long as I have that. There&#39;s literally no point for movie theaters anymore, especially when you&#39;re spending fifty dollars on popcorn and a drink... I mean get the fuck outta here with that bs. Movie theaters wouldn&#39;t be dying if they&#39;d just lower their ridiculous prices on fucking popcorn. They&#39;re all smoking crack over there, though, so whatever. Popcorn is good, but it&#39;s not $50 good.
Scott Barnes is gifted Master Artist 🎨 and  also  Master Creative Make up Artist!  He is a Genius!
I think Tammy is being encouraged by the show&#39;s producers to gain weight and fight with her siblings. This is what makes good ratings and keeps the money flowing. Tammy probably figures that making tons of money is worth the risk to her health. She&#39;s going to play this for all its worth for the next couple of years, however long this drama will keep the ratings high, then she&#39;ll get serious about the weight loss.
I&#39;d love to see how these people are able to sit down in these outfits, and how they must &quot;bleed over&quot; and crowd out the people in the seats next to them!
I have severe endometriosis and myofascial pain syndrome. If I don’t move, everything fuses. I can’t breathe or sleep without pain and spasms in my rib cage and pelvis. I’ve started doing yoga before bed to get blood flowing. Helping so far…..
I was able to lose 60 lbs since August and I feel so much better. I ate so horribly and so much. I fed myself on fast food, sugary drinks, and candy, so much candy. I got up to 250lbs.<br><br>My doctor put me on a Ketogenic diet (with lots of cruciferous vegetables and salads), while I also did intermittent fasting and I was able to lose all of that weight. I was able to get off of the heartburn medicine that I was on and I just feel overall so much healthier. Plus being able to fit into thinner clothes was an added benefit as well.<br><br>I did get quite alot of help by using Factor the meal delivery service to order the correct kind of food, but it is way healthier than fast food and is about the same if maybe cheaper than what I was spending on fast food.<br><br>My relationship with sugar and food in general has changed so much. I am no longer being dictated by food and I have so much more time than waiting in lines for fast food.<br><br>I would like to transition to cooking from scratch all of the food that I want to eat, but my current work and living situation makes that difficult, but in the future I am going to work on that as well.<br><br>I also need to build more muscle and lose more fat.
As someone who has been on the side of super restricted food intake (one meal a day barley a portion size sometimes not eating at all) if I had to sit down and watch someone eat how I used to eat it would break me.
😭 i eat 400 kcals a day but binge up to a kilo of cabbage every day at 5 am 😭😭 cant stop helpp
I love that sweater💕💕
That&#39;s all she know how to do is talk about her.Disgusting
Can you eat a man, and grow a voice?
There is no real reason to go back to either church or synagogue. One judges and lies, the other is an outdate rule book of survival tips for a long ago era. Christian faith is well meaning, most of it and most of them, however, they believe several false premises based on a book written thousands of years ago for a different culture in at least three different languages. 
<br>
<br>It&#39;s been translated badly from the originals and the intent and meaning inadvertently and advertently, meaningfully and indirectly changed by culture, language, and not so well meaning heads of the church and well meaning but un-knowning translators. 
<br>
<br>It was written by men and there are many contradictions. Used to believe in the christian ideas but it&#39;s clear it&#39;s not God that they usually profess about and confound others with. If something doesn&#39;t make sense with itself, if something seems like it is NOT God, it&#39;s NOT God. 
<br>
<br>God made Adam with Even inside him and in his image, therefore God has both male and female aspects. In addition, the Bible doesn&#39;t tell all---God had to make other Adams and Eves after the first otherwise we&#39;re a race born from incest and we’re still incestors or incesting. Shhh. We’re not. 
<br>
<br>In addition, there were whole books of the Bible that some Pope decreed as not part of the Bible and took away. In those books, among other things, was the belief of reincarnation. Most Christians before that (and some after that) believed in reincarnation. 
<br>
<br>Not eating meat on Fridays was because…the fishing industry needed a boost. That had nothing to do with God. 
<br>
<br>There are also those in the Christian/Catholic faith that are NOT well meaning. Well, I guess. Was it well meaning to try to force Christianity on natives who believed otherwise? I guess it was to save their souls, which was meaningless. Was it Christianity to cause wars against the Mid Easterners who held the “Holy Land” (Christians lost that war BTW)?  Was it Christianity to allow the Children’s Crusades, which led to hundreds of children and teenagers being sold into slavery and those that weren’t died? 
<br>
<br>Some time ago, the Pope felt bad about all the artefacts that the Catholics stole from the Jews after KILLING them (your weapons are what now?) and decided to open up the vaults of the Vatican. He declared that he wanted to give back HALF of what was stolen by murder. How nice of him? 
<br>
<br>God is not a human being. He does not punish, he does not kill, he does not hate, he does not seek revenge, he does not make anyone suffer, he does not allow anything near a hell to exist or a demonic devil of evil to exist. God loves and his actions follow suit in that. He/she is not like us when we are out of the spirit and let’s face it, most of us are out of the spirit in our actions most of the time. The Bible is wrong on many counts and accounts. Yet at times it is correct. It cannot be the last word on God and spirituality. It was made by well meaning people (Most of them) to keep order in a confusing, murderous world of people gone wild. And it worked…until it was then used to create more strife, more rivals groups, and more division. 
<br>
<br>There are only two categories of people: those in the spirit and acting as such and the other category of those who are NOT in the spirit and acting as such. 
<br>
<br>Kirk Cameron and his end of the world movies are science fiction supernatural wrongness in their filthy “I’m right and you’re wrong and will die for it and suffer in hell for eternity” nonsense. Truth is: THEY are wrong and that will NEVER happen that way at all and certainly we are nowhere near an event or events like that. Or Damien the OMEN. 
<br>
<br>Anyway, NO ONE has to fear death. Betty White has a good perspective BUT even if someone didn&#39;t live a full life like she did or made more mistakes than she did, NO ONE has to fear death. 
<br>
<br>
<br>I know it&#39;s a very human thing to do but experts say that being born into this world is a more traumatic event than death and leaving this world. I know you said that no one knows for sure what happens to us when we die but that&#39;s not accurate. Many do know. For me, personally, it&#39;s beyond faith now. I have so much evidence of an after life and of a God (by the way God has male/female aspects of him/herself---I don&#39;t fully believe in the Bible as a last word but think about this: God took EVE OUT OF ADAM so Adam was he/she, too before that and if God made US in his image, then He/She is like that, too). 
<br>
<br>Even people who have made the wrong choices and been &quot;bad&quot; have a chance at redemption, and yes even Hitler. God loves and forgives EVERYONE (she/he does not play favorites). It&#39;s hard for us as humans who are not God to understand that. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Now, if there are a small percentage of human beings who are the dark ones (and only by their choice), they have turned their backs on God BUT here and there they have a chance to change their minds (a few that are both dark/light humans DO but most dark ones do not) and if they do not, even they will be brought somehow into God&#39;s light (of this I&#39;m a bit unsure as to how). 
<br>
<br>A loving God would not do some of the things written down about him. These things were written for another time and another place and another culture to keep law and order which in the far past, most did not have, in fact at one point very few individuals had and chaos almost ruled so well meaning men and some women wrote down laws and rules to follow to keep man and woman kind from exterminating themselves. 
<br>
<br>Some of these may have come from God (of which ones I&#39;m unsure). I am sure about this: God would not allow a devil like we think of as the devil (there IS an angel in charge of the Dark Ones to make sure they do NOT do much damage). 
<br>
<br>God would not allow eternal damnation and suffering so I&#39;m sorry horror fans there is NO hell. None. There are no demons. Only beliefs can make your own spirit create your own hell and your own demons. NO ONE is going to a fire pit for eternity to suffer forever: God, a loving God (and she/he is) would never allow that or let that exist. 
<br>
<br>GOD LOVES. NO ONE has to fear death of any kind because death is just a transition. No one is lost, no one is gone, no one vanishes forever. I think even people who don&#39;t believe in God and an afterlife deep down know this somewhere inside them. And these things are not just my opinion, my belief, my whatever. These things I have written here ARE FACT. 
<br>
<br>Of course with free will, your beliefs may vary but I&#39;m sorry about that but even that&#39;s okay, you are still, against all human media and human nature, SAFE FOREVER. No one has to worry or fear death ever. And even if you do, when it happens and you transition to the other side, you&#39;ll be as perfect as you were when you were created. 
<br>
<br>Chances are you&#39;ve been through a life and death before (some have been through it a lot----the church once believed in reincarnation until some pope in Venice decided that he wanted to take holy parts of the &quot;holy&quot; Bible out and censored it. 
<br>
<br>Don&#39;t rely on a billion year old book or books to know what your spirit inside, some of us deep inside, already knows: God is a loving God, God does not judge or punish or allow evil, God does not go against anyone&#39;s free will, and God has provided for an afterlife that is nothing like us sitting on clouds doing nothing but sleeping, resting, and playing harps. 
<br>
<br>Heaven is nothing like we think: it is the most excellent energy, the most wonderful of multiverses and you will have lots to do (that you WANT and LOVE to do) and the energy to do it.
Instead of traditional pasta dishes I make grilled chicken bits with spicy seasoning, and a mix of veggies with some corn, and then a fraction of a serving of pearled couscous and mix it together. The pasta (couscous) makes up a very small amount of the overall food, and paired with the small amount of corn, it is very filling. The other veggies (broccoli, carrots, peppers etc) and the chicken make up most of the dish. I use a little canola oil and occasionally a tablespoon of butter total in an amount that has 2-3 servings. Not a perfect dish for health but quite healthy especially compared with a large plate of spaghetti or whatever you may be indulging in too frequently. High in protein, low in refined carbs (comparatively with other pasta dishes) and fairly high amount of fiber depending on how many veggies you use. But it may not satiate your hunger as much if you are pounding refined carbs and junk food throughout the day. If you are being pretty healthy throughout the day, this is a great meal.
America may not the most obese, but they are the most unnecessarily obese
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”<br>5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️<br>6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death.
All the crayon eyeliners are so thick, I don&#39;t like bold ones. Are there any thinner ones?
I have tattoos for people I love. One for my late grandfather, one for my late grandmother, one for my dog who passed away. Oh and one that I actually do regret getting a little 😂 but I plan on covering it up or removing it eventually. And I will be getting two more small tattoos, one for each of my sons.
The best part of socialism Vs capitalism is slaves Vs willing slaves. If a normal slave from socialism is beaten I feel horrible, if a capitalist slave asks to be beaten for profit it turns me on. Big difference. That&#39;s why I&#39;m a capitalist, we don&#39;t have to force our whores directly, we can force them second hand, and that makes it okay. You people are so fucking stupid lol.
Dawn trained her body to lower its basal metabolic rate to match her reduced caloric intake and then when the weekend came her body go crazy to absorb and set aside as much as her food intake and as reserve (a.k.a. Fat). 😅 counterintuitive if you asked me;)
Ticks are not invasive species as a whole. There are some species of ticks that are invasive, such as the Asian longhorned ticks that have been introduced to North America but there are also many species of tick native to North America. And ticks ARE an important part of their ecosystems, just like sharks. They are a major part of the foodwebs and they also help control populations of animals by infecting them. Ticks are also an easy to study proxy for overall ecosystem health and scientists frequently use tick populations to determine overall ecosystem health. I would bet the person that privated her channel did so after being called out for what sounds like a completely BS story. If tick eggs hatch in your home you would have an infestation of larval ticks, which are the size of a grain of sand. The average person looking at an infestation of larval ticks wouldn&#39;t know what they were. Also, the cow killed by the &quot;super ticks,&quot; which are the Asian longhorned ticks, was not an adult cow and it didn&#39;t die of exsanguination, it died of anemia. All five of the cows mentioned in the article that died from tick infestation belonged to the same farmer who clearly was not practicing proper pest control and his herd may not have been very healthy to start with.<br><br>All that said, ticks are very unpleasant creatures and it is important to avoid getting them on yourself, your family, and your pets when possible. An important note on that subject, tick repellents don&#39;t necessarily repel ticks they just hide you from the tick so it will ignore you. Even if you&#39;re wearing repellent and treating your pets, it is still necessary to do a tick check after any time outdoors.
I&#39;m happy that I have a high degree of self-control when it comes to things like the amount of food I eat. It&#39;s more the composition that I have trouble controlling.
Im a binge eater; someone once told me it was fine because you body will not be able to assimilate the food if you eat it fast enough, so you wont take in all the calories... it didnt help me with my binges 😓
I don&#39;t want to be the idiot who&#39;s calling God queer. If this is an example of their reason and logic I maintain that yes, they have serious mental health issues and should be treated as such.
Interesting - as a T1D since 1972, aspartame was pretty much forced on me if I wanted diet soda like Tab at the time.  As I got older, I heard rumors and various discussions about aspartame that it causes cancer only in super high doses and some may have allergic-like reactions.  Those same rumors were around with Saccharin too which was also one of the only options available for those like me.  Today, NutraSweet is a stevia and erythritol blend using &quot;rebaudioside m&quot;, a component of Stevia that is supposedly sweeter and less bitter.  Personally, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the flavor of Stevia and erythritol gets tricky with the weird cooling sensation in some recipes and amounts.  I can say aspartame, being one of the few sweeteners I was able to take advantage of so long ago (and is still in some diet sodas), I&#39;ve never knowingly had any issues or concerns with blood sugar impact being my primary concern.  Today, while I do still drink lots of zero-sugar stuff like Pepsi, 7Up, etc I prefer to use Allulose in almost everything I cook if the dish needs to be sweet.  Really great job with the research, details, and walkthrough.  Thank you for putting this out there!
Shame is great motivator and work fine for lot of people. To be nice not always helps sometimes you have to feel discomfort from outside to wake up your true self.
You&#39;re so funny. I&#39;ve always thought a long bob would look great on you. I hope you&#39;re feeling better. 💜
This video was foreshadowing to Kylie&#39;s dollar tree vegan leather brushes.
Judging by today&#39;s society I&#39;d be surprised if fat camp isn&#39;t changed to something like &quot;fitness camp&quot; or &quot;gym camp&quot; or something less insulting
You can tell Jeffree is a pure person with how he treats all animals around him✨
Tati! You’re my absolute favorite go to for accuracy in your descriptions and recommendations, thank you! I live in the Caribbean and have been having problems following seasonal trends (fall and winter looks that hold up in the heat and humidity) I know you had some great tips whenever you’re on a trip but could you go through your goodie closets for us snowbirds? ❤❤❤❤
The purple ended up looking great!
Bought this palette after your recommendation and I love it!  I use it often and feel guilty about abandoning some of my other great palettes but it is such a fun palette with the different looks achievable.  Thanx for another great review.  And yes I also wish the zebra package was different but I’ll live with it considering the inside is awesome 😎

21 Senators are between the ages of 70 and 80 with 50% of the Senate being over 65. 46% of the Senate Democrats are in this age range along with 54% of the Senate Republicans. 32% of the House is 65+ with 40% of the House Democrats and 23% of House Republicans. <br><br>These are scary statistics when the median age of the American citizen is only 38.8 years old. This is a problem on both sides. <br><br>Every person of power in government, especially those in the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court should be required to have a yearly physical including a mental health screening, including a yearly mental fitness/competency test if they&#39;re over the age of 65. These results must all be made public. These also should be required before a potential candidate can enter or announce their run for office, no matter the age, but especially in instances where the candidate has had some sort of illness or injury that could affect mental capacity, such as, you know, a stroke.<br><br>Laundry list of requirements we should have, I know. But our Founding Fathers didn&#39;t have to deal with these things. People didn&#39;t live long enough to experience mental deterioration in the same way that we do today.
You’ll call her out on her delusions about fat acceptance, but are perfectly fine with playing into her “they/them” BS? 🤔
I lost a friend cause she was jealous I was getting married and lost weight so I was the same size as her and she couldn&#39;t take it. Breaking point for her was the guy she liked tried to hit on me, I rejected him cause I was engaged (and girl code) but she was so angry at me. And I totally know she was just envious of my life
I find it interesting that being skinny for women is viewed as awesome, but for men you&#39;re not seen as manly(this isn&#39;t to even bring up the health of the person; being skinny isn&#39;t necessarily healthy). Basically the same issue but different outcomes. An actual positivity movement could really tackle both sides but it seems the movement only wants to focus on women. It&#39;s kind of sad b/c that&#39;s just a further reinforcement of the gender stereotypes that are damaging us.
There&#39;s always someone more beautiful, richer, happier, more loved and more succesful than you.  The thing is: everyone are the main characters of their own stories, and a supporting character, an antagonist, an extra, or whatever in other people&#39;s stories - and pain us unavoidable. <br>Fun fact: a girl&#39;s self-esteem normaly is linked to her relationship with her father, even if she turns out to be a lesbian, and not much with her actual attractiveness (yes, you can have an extremely attractive tik tok woman that will fall for an abusive partner because deep down she hates herself and didn&#39;t learn what is love and respect). <br>Yes, people will treat you differently if you&#39;re pretty, but if your self-esteem is good enough, it won&#39;t matter how strangers treat you in normal daily life situations.
She is not an atheist! <br>she just said that God is good and he does good things and good things aren&#39;t happening to her right now.<br>An atheist doesn&#39;t believe God is good or bad just that God does not <a href="http://exists.it/">exists.it</a> just sounds like you are peddling doubt for satan just because good things are happening to you he must not exist. That&#39;s definitely not a measure of his existence. You don&#39;t worship him he does not know you. The one that you do worship is out of default. When you deny the father based on your lack of blessings as a measure of his existence that is kind of an oxymoron or just a moron
Your videos are so helpful to me on my weight loss journey. They help me to stay focused on my goals❤
Okay... but on the other hand... there pretty girls and sparkly dresses still have freedom of speech. There are still people and still care about human issues.. so like I agree with using caution when listening, and being strong minded enough to take in informations calmly and develop your own opinion.. I don&#39;t think we should be telling them not to speak on something cuz their stupid.. we don&#39;t know her whole story and any personal reason she feels compelled to speak... ja feel? Or no?
When I had weight loss surgery one of the things I did was  I went on roller coasters too because I couldn&#39;t previously, so I can totally relate to Chris.
And still the super skinny one&#39;s look better than the big one&#39;s :/
i’m 12, and 188 lbs (last time I was weighed) and i’m 5’4. i’m gonna start trying to lose weight by learning different types of dances like jumpstyle (I think it looks super fun and I love the music the people dance to) i’m also gonna try to eat less. I’ve honestly have been trying to lose weight for a while but I would lose then gain but i’m trying! :3
I’m obese but I would never blame anyone but myself for what I did to myself.
It looks like he identifies as trans fat.
Like some other people below say, the mental health aspect is so important. I was having a rough patch last 2 years with toxic relationships, eventual suicidal ideations even, losing hope in life. Going out from that hole made things so much easier. Feeling loved and accepted for who I was, even with the weight I put on because of binge eating, having more activities to do.. It all helped so much. I still find myself skipping meals, sometimes accidentally, sometimes because I&#39;m sometimes afraid to start eating for the day- I know I have more way to go. Still feeling guilty over eating &quot;too much&quot;, for having a piece of chocolate, worrying if I trigger myself into a binge. Just ate a praline, drank a cup of tea and hey, I&#39;m not binging :) Idk it&#39;s just so good not to be that bloated self.
I don’t understand how McDonald’s is more convenient. It takes way more time to go get McDonald’s then fry an egg. It takes maybe 5 minutes to cook eggs. My normal breakfast of 1 egg, chopped spinach, chopped tomato, cut up turkey pepperoni scrambled together and wrapped in a spinach tortilla with hot sauce takes me maybe 7 minutes to prepare and cook. And it’s healthy and filling and balanced. I get it’s not everyone’s cup of tea but I mean how is driving to a store and sitting in a drive through and then feeling gross by the time you get to work more convenient
For me, maintaining weight loss is 10x harder than losing it.  Could you do a vid on how to manage weight loss since those fat cells don&#39;t ever go away and just craving to be filled up?  It feels defeating. Much love!
It’s not the companies’ fault! It’s the kid(s) and the parent’s fault. Companies can’t force you to eat their product. You as a parent choose what your kid can and can’t eat. Banning cartoons off fast food and junk food is BS. That’s marketing… nothing wrong with that. But it’s you, the parent(s) who makes the decision if you will buy said product for your kid. But, when the parent(s) gives said option to the kid, it’s now up to the child to make the best decision. Now, said child will most likely choose as their parents would, thus meaning if the parents set good examples, the child would most likely pick out healthier options… and then splurge every now and then. You may be asking how do I know? Cause this is how I am being raised. I’m 16 and a half now, in high school, and I make plenty of my own decisions. Almost all of which were influenced by my parents. I know I have insane metabolism, but I admit, I do eat junk food. It’s just I’m constantly burning those extra calories. On an average day, I need as much as 2500 calories. On weeks when I’m up at the fire college with my explorer post doing training for up to 10 hours, I easily eat 3000-3500 calories and plenty of water and electrolytes. I know my body type, how active I am, and how fast process proteins, carbohydrates/sugars, fats, and other nutrients. That’s being said, my parents guided me throughout life to make a good, solid choice when it comes to a meal. This is why I stand by the claim, “ The parents and children are the problem… not the companies.” Change my mind….
I hope you would make video on intermittent fasting in the future and it&#39;s benefits in loosing weight
YESSSS YOU BOUGHT YUCCA!!!!!! Lemme get my popcorn. Cannot keep my fat little fingers out of those metallics its so much LOVEEEEEEE for me!!!
If I were her sister, I&#39;d lock her in a room and give her a strict as all hell diet until she loses weight. Once she&#39;s able to walk on her own, I&#39;d leave. That&#39;s it. She&#39;s an adult. She can take care of herself after that. I would literally be so done with her so quickly
Mike Jeffries was ugly A/F yet he graded employees by their looks
Every interview that was featured wasn’t really about the person being interviewed. She framed everything in a certain way so that the conversation ALWAYS went back to her. Gross.
Ok but it’s ment for already applied makeup not thick swatches
One of my biggest concerns would be triggering even more unhealthy behaviors in the “super skinny” participants because they are so disgusted by the food they’ve had to eat for a week.
Kiana, this is the first video of yours I saw and I&#39;ve been marathoning your stuff since. You motivated me to buckle up and make healthier choices for myself. I don&#39;t weigh that much, but I&#39;ve not been happy with the weight gain I&#39;ve been having. My brother and I agreed to do this together. He&#39;s got a longer journey ahead, but we&#39;re going to be each other&#39;s cheerleaders and ensure we lose weight, keep it off, and stay fit! Thank you. In just a day you opened my eyes to face reality that we need to make changes NOW.
You explained the concept of intuitive eating quite precisely ;). And although you might speak quite critically about HAES in one of your videos, you just pointed out some of the main principles around HAES food advice :). Eat when you&#39;re hungry. Stop when you&#39;re full. Include feel-good movement. Eat fibre. Enjoy your meal with all senses.  What a certain Instagram culture made of this inclusive movement and its good intention ... well, I share your criticism at some point. By the way these principles equal the principles of Intuitive Eating (such facts combined with audios for subconscious changes). 1. Eat when you&#39;re hungry. 2. Eat what makes you feel happy and healthy. 3. Enjoy your meal and trust your hunger signals. 4. Stop when you feel adequalely satiated. Started both HAES theory and Intuitive Eating practice to get back in line with my body and to make peace with it. Most ironically, lost weight with it. Now I&#39;m combining both aspects and write about HAES and body-related topics in my blog,, among other topics  :). Another fun fact at this point ... In earlier times, social pressure and negative feelings led to emotional eating (my Intuitive Eating programme steps into the subconscious part of emotional eating) and since I have been practising this idea (theoretically it was known to me through HAES), the same negative emotions result in  total lack of appetite so I must force myself to eat then. Sorry long post - but might be helpful for you :).
Size dosent matter but age does
a free nation is the most terroristic nation cause its a mutiny of illetrates..............other than saying a &quot;free&quot; nation..............better say an &quot;educated nation&quot;.........nothing more and nothing less....................educative prospect is totalitariately different from work or any other religious prospect &quot;(generally)&quot;...............it makes u to know ur place........no matter what.................phylosophy and science is an edcative prospect................when ever i have heard the polititians wrath exercising and therefore wrath polarizing the public in that direction..............in itself is the 2nd biggest form of terrorism.........precisely after indoctrination precisely religion..........then freedom(it lies on the second rank)
Strangely enough we&#39;re told in the UK we were at our healthiest during WW2, due to food rationing. No obesity, and the poor were guaranteed meat in their diet on a regular basis.<br>Yet at the same time the meals people invented during rationing are the bloody disgusting meals people associate with Britain today, long after they&#39;ve gone out of regular usage.
I&#39;m know this is a 3 year old video, but boy does it ever hit me hard. I&#39;m trying to keep to 1200 calories per day, and feel so guilty when I don&#39;t, and relieved when I do. I check all labels for calories and sugar and it just consumes my life to lose weight. I&#39;m an emotional eater too.
Has anyone problems with setting spray making their hair gross ?
And then you realize it was their father&#39;s batter that went into that cake.
The milk was better than one size the milk one didn’t much like at all
&quot;That&#39;s kinda what we are designed for.&quot; Excuse me? What exactly is it you want to imply here. This woman is working at home on her podcast promoting women&#39;s safety talking about the for left and how women&#39;s rights are being taken away. Are you forgetting that back before electricity was invented everything was made by hand. The women were working they just did it by pretty much making everything the family needed that the husband would never do in his entire life. Plus nurses female nurses that were the closest things to female doctors also existed. It is something that has always existed. Mid wife&#39;s don&#39;t forget hand maids female slaves. Seamstresses and female politicians in royalty. Not to mention elders and nuns any other kind of work that women were able to get. It all depended mostly on their education and class pretty much. You can&#39;t afford education if you have to pay for it and you are poor. No one stops to think about that do they? Be grateful for you got today ladies. If you do not then history is doomed to repeat.
I loved it. and if you think the movie was about making fun of a fat man, you clearly missed the point. You probably never have wathed a Darren Aaronovsky film before. The move wasnt about a fat guy, but his redemption. Its a redemption story.
The only people mad at that line are actual skinny bitches. Women like that don&#39;t like us real curvy girls go talk about it so fuck it !
I&#39;m a fat, middle-aged, upper middle-class, conservative, happily married white woman. Who am I supposed to blame my obesity on? These people are nuts.
How can a father steel money from his son? And what&#39;s up with the mother? The parents are blaming others. Surprise... noot...
“It’s because they experienced something earlier in their life that distorted the way they meet their needs” ‼️‼️‼️ I don’t know if you’ve done a video particularly on this but what a wonderful way of putting it. Knowing our needs and meeting our needs is such an important subject for everyone, regardless of their health or weight or psychological status.
How does a man have sex with a porcupine? Very carefully. Just ask the father of whatever that thing is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLsr8wl7j2Q&amp;t=4m11s">4:11</a>.
I was about to comment that I&#39;ve never felt insecure about my appearance, even though I&#39;m not exactly a D-cup model with long flowing hair xD But then I remembered the first time I went to Paris and how me and my sister felt like absolute trolls. Sure, we&#39;re skinny, but being Dutch, we felt so tall and unelegant compared to all the petite girls with thick, dark hair and mysterious dark eyes there. Somehow, everyone we saw in Paris who was our age, was ridiculously attractive looking. So yeah, I don&#39;t get insecure easily, but when surrounded by people who are all more elegant than I am... I totally get the feeling.
My question is is your Merch in kid sizes
I think Google become fat activist.
Suger doesnt cause weight gain directly, fat does. Dairy like cheese, milk etc are superfoods designed to make babies gain weight. When you eat suger as well, you use the sugers 1st, then the other stuff like dairy get stored as fat. Too much suger while over weight means not all the suger is being used, and that causes type 2 diabetes. Reducing suger is a good idea, but stopping dairy is far more effective. Also, dont eat on a schedule, only eat when your actually hungry. Most people have no idea what actual hunger is though..
god, i used to be so miserable when i worked in hospitality. it was my WORST nightmare. i worked as a barista in a small family owned specialty coffee chain and they lived by &#39;the customer is always right&#39;. their big thing was to NEVER ask customers to leave, even after closing. in the summer, we had beautiful tables on a tall building&#39;s terrace overlooking the city and it was so nice at night. our business hours were 8AM-10PM but the strict company policy was to never ever kick guests out. they&#39;d let them sit outside until 11-12PM before very gently telling them we closed two hours ago, we would not get paid overtime, and on top of that, there was 30 more minutes of work to be done AFTER the last customers leave for closing. the place was located in an extremely boujee neighborhood and the people were very affluent and so incredibly entitled and abused the company policy to the fullest, only to leave a $1 tip for three people who stayed well into the night to accommodate them... it was the worst two years of my life working there. i was so unhappy. i hated our regulars from the bottom of my heart. DIRTY rich, zero manners, never tipped, talking about how they&#39;re cleaning their ex wives in divorces and sleeping with teenaged girls... there was one regular who had six sons by like 5 different wives, he would come in with them and his little ipad, order a single americano (no tip) and leave his six kids to terrorize the staff who had to keep them entertained (the youngest was maybe 18 months) and everyone had to suck it up because he was friends with the owners. when he was bored of his stupid offspring, he&#39;d bring them to us to babysit for free. never ordered a single drink/juice/food for the kids. i would literally walk up to a table without saying hello or smiling and just asking what can i get you. no hello, no goodbye, that job sucked the life out of me. i quit two years ago and i genuinely feel like i&#39;m still carrying that fatigue and stress in my bones.
He&#39;s just making fun of women,  doing his disgusting,  silly woman-face act. It&#39;s hard to believe people take him seriously.
They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re just lying to avoid accountability. Disgusting.
Ben Shapiro is disgusting!
Body shaming is FOUL and its especially disgusting when women are body shaming other women. Every single one of us has had a mean, unwelcome commitment about our bodies, before. EVERY ONE of us. The fact that they know how that feels and do it anyway, to anyone, makes me SICK.
I listen to podcast originally and was inspired to see if there was a video and here I am 😘. I just have to say I was touched by the transparency of Jada’s mom when she said “ what you really are is a judgmental bitch”. That statement was a key a opportunity for freedom.  I do not think I have ever witnessed this the ability to not have fear of judgment.  The bondage of judgement is a double edged sword it goes both ways.  Great shot thanks for the wow moment

I don&#39;t imagine people like her to lose weight? I mean if they re so big and helpless but manage to have such a mean spirit and make everyone around you miserable how would they be when they lose weight ?
No matter Adeles size she&#39;s a beautiful strong woman. Tabloids are scum.
Wtf ben.This is how society percieves women including u.U make vids shaming overweight women and now act like it never happens.Grow tf up.
I’m sorry I don’t feel sorry at all for people who are addicted to fast food. I just don’t. In the end it’s still choice. If a piece of food could make someone that ill like we see the lady in black practically vomit as if it’s a dead body, but she can handle fast food so easily, Fuck her. People act like they have no choice. They still have a choice. They can put something different into their damn mouth but they don’t want to because they want the pleasure of their fast food so let America die in its unhealthy decisions. I’m sick of people making excuses about why Americans are so fat and unhealthy. You’re adults not children. Put the damn shit that’s healthy in your mouth and swallow it. Unless you have issues that literally prevent you from eating, then you can do it. You just don’t want to.
This is an excellent chat. I&#39;ve been watching this podcast for some time now, but none of the other episodes (no shade) have hit me like this one. I&#39;m going through my own path of forgiveness and I didn&#39;t have the true connection between forgiveness and freedom but now it&#39;s so apparent. I&#39;m excited to catapult myself into this forgiveness so I, too, can rid myself of the shackles of non-forgiveness.
I remember going to a music festival a few years ago in Rimini, near Bologna Italy. I loved the beaches but I know a lot of Italian&#39;s say the beaches there suck 🤣<br><br>There were no McDonald&#39;s or fast food places within several miles. Nearly EVERYONE was in great shape, it completely put me to shame. I saw like 2 overweight people (1 of them sadly being myself,) there over the 3-4 days I visited, I couldn&#39;t believe it. Everyone was either lean or near jacked. Then came back to my home city in the north of the UK and it was business as usual, about 50% of people obese.....
Americans prefer to eat one fast food per day?? Like breakfast or lunch or dinner or what? Why y&#39;all so lazy fat fucks?
Never knee how to describe it to someone how i still felt &quot;fat&quot; in my now healthy body but you said it the best in here! Thanks 😊
Why the hell are muckbangs so popular? watching people gorge themselves is disgusting.
Such hideous people......disgusting
Diet is gross.
I think Tess and Gwen should be forced to do a Supersize vs Super-skinny diet swap. Then at the end of the week, confront Tess and be like, &quot;But did you die???&quot; She&#39;ll probably be 40 lbs lighter too.
No more animal fats.
This is about the left, in the USA especially, tearing down the institutions and principles that this country had as the directing force to govern this nation.The left is anti God, anti constitution, anti individual freedom, anti family and anti American. The left are mostly from the democrat party  and are Marxist,socialist and communist , this is what they mean by progressive and liberal. As Hillary Clinton mused, &quot;The Maga Republicans need RETRAINING CAMPS&quot; to brainwash them to Marxism, or perhaps to exterminate them.(concentration camps?) John F Kennedy would be considered a &quot;MAGA REPUBLICAN&quot; today by the &quot;liberal left&quot;.
very good and informative video, Kiana! I&#39;m seeking advice in the following: I&#39;m 17 years old, have circled through various disordered eating patterns for the past 4 years (binging, purging and restricting cycles), tried intermittent fasting up to 50 hours, counted calories and tried every diet. i&#39;m at a healthy weight now and in recovery from restricting and started HRT (testosterone) maybe 6 months ago. Everything came crashing down on my body since then and I&#39;ve had some intense changes in my appetite and metabolism (that is expected on T HRT, but i&#39;m struggling to manage my eating habits). I try to not eat a lot more than I have before but my cortisol is at an all time high. I&#39;m very active (taking care of various animals and also endurance running) and I&#39;m so so scared of gaining weight. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with severe hypoglycemia(on the verge of vomiting) and have to eat even though i have had dinner (veggies, fiber, protein, slow carbs) maybe 4-5hrs prior. My sugar keeps crashing multiple times a day and Ive come close to collapsing from hypoglycemia multiple times even though I eat normally moderate portions 4 times a day(no fast food, lots of fruit and veg, oatmeal, whole grain, greek yogurt, lean meat, white rice). Is there anyone who has any advice or anything? I&#39;m desperate for anything.
Anorexics look in the mirror and think they`re fat, so possible she could have it. 😁😆🤣
Does the the Lawless gloss have a sting to it from the plumper? Anyone know?
I have put on lots of weight in the last few years. It’s because I eat like a pig. And eat all the bad foods.<br>No point in hiding the truth
Not eating is kinda automatic weight loss lol. It even saves you money!
Makes you fat. Makes you sick. They feed you drugs. The cycle of corporate greed! Food, Drugs, insurance. FDA is mafia.
Help lol I have not tried anything I was 21 walked into MAC and they colored matched my foundation I felt like a princess lol MAC studio sculpt spf foundation NC30 I think, but I feels heavy on me like if I need to put on a whole face of makeup then I use it. Also they pared it with medium plus mineralize I was 21 then and I’m 35 sad I need help I want something that makes me feel fresh easy on the coverage
As soon as you bring up &#39;fatphobia&#39; you&#39;ve  lost me. None of you subsequent arguments will be taken as valid. :)
K Brett I like your content and all, BUT glock s are ugly, I would prefer a 19-11 any day
I am down to 23% bodyfat 116.6kg from 25% bodyfat 123kg(thats 271lbs for americans) over the past few weeks.
I think that this product getting smaller and more expensive is actually helping me lose weight because I only buy stuff when it&#39;s worth my money (has a good unit price) 😅
If simple carbohydrates are not very good for a diet, does anyone know if fats like butter, milk, cheese are okay in moderation? Or would it be best to avoid them as well?
Thanks for watching! Check out my other videos:<br><b>This is Why I Stretch EVERY DAY</b> - <a href="https://youtu.be/01LbcCDTwF4">https://youtu.be/01LbcCDTwF4</a><br><b>Disgusting Ticks Are Ruining My Life</b> - <a href="https://youtu.be/4pWlRpW3ZR0">https://youtu.be/4pWlRpW3ZR0</a>
I actually love the LA Girl tinted foundation,  it&#39;s lightweight on my skin but covered me well.  Enjoyed this video.  And Juvias place eyeshadow is fanominal,  I have several pallets that I love.
The Ugly Narcissist embodiment, how dare she attacking a gentle soul like Johnny Depp? I was so satisfied she lost the case &amp; been exposed to the whole world
Plzzz do a full face of one sizeee!!
Obese people generally live off the government they don&#39;t contribute to society it&#39;s a drain on social security
as a former fat person, it doesnt seem at all that you don&#39;t hate fat people. Fat people hate fat people and you just make them come out of their cognitive dissonance.
This is so disgusting to watch they call Jesus non binary, Jesus is gay... In muslims we believe Jesus also called as Isaa alaihasalam is Allah&#39;s Prophet , we being a muslim never ever make fun of him and these people are derange ... This is Sad !!!
Loved the movie so much. But the Strange stuff, in the beginning, was off like Shapiro says. What gets me is that in Endgame, the Ancient One says that Dr. Strange was supposed to be &quot;the best of us&quot; referring to sorcerer supremes throughout history. At the beginning here, Strange who is supposed to be the adult acts like the stereotypical irresponsible reckless teenager misusing freedom, strength, responsibility, etc more than spiderman does. This is especially true when you consider Wong&#39;s warnings. That does fit his personality though. But it was a great movie. Top 5 Marvel movies for me.
They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re just lying to avoid accountability. Disgusting.
I&#39;m gonna be real with y&#39;all, losing weight is challenging. It took me 2 years to finally beat obesity, and most of the weight loss only started happening after a few months. There were many nights of feeling miserable for having a craving. I dreaded exercise but slowly learned to love activity in my own way. The worst part was looking in the mirror and wondering if anything I was doing was actually going to work. The progress was slow but necessary. It didn&#39;t help me feel less ashamed in clothes or that I couldn&#39;t eat certain foods. Oddly enough I made far more progress after learning to love myself unconditionally no matter what state my body was in. Learning to appreciate food from a holistic sense really helped. The clothes part can still be a challenge today, even when people say I look good. But that&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll work on that.
I know it&#39;s not super luxury but high end my ride or dies are makeup by Mario soft sculpt skin enhancer and makeup forever aqua resist eyeliner and mac fix plus. And my highest definitely luxury semi-beauty item is Bacarat Rouge perfume.
I did that a lot along my child and teenagehood, then I stoped for 4 years! Lost a lot of weight. <br><br>However, in the pandemics and with other life problems, this behavior came back. I gained 40kg. <br><br>Now it&#39;s been five months of living a healthy lifestyle. I&#39;ve lost 10kg however the will to binge eat is still very present, specially in harsh days....
Lol someone had to tell her. Well said, what she’s done is disgusting and if it wasn’t so messed up it would be almost comical.
I&#39;m glad I watched this video, as someone who&#39;s struggled with being the chubby kid all my life, when i looked through your channel I got extremely bad vibes. Because I am someone activeley working on myself. Eating better, exercising, everything. But when I saw your videos all I saw were clickbait titles and I got very uncomfortable. I wasn&#39;t even aware of this fat positive movement, I was only ever aware of the bigger body positive movement. Which I am very much in support of. And I&#39;m glad you clarified obese because a lot of people think overweight and obese are the same thing and they very much aren&#39;t.
i always said that if i ever won an academy award..i would show up in the clothing expected and then right before i went on stage to collect my award i would tear off my clothes revealing a potato sack..wipe off the makeup and take my hair down,,leave my shoes under the chair and walk up on stage and tell the audience to give it to someone who needs it more than i want it...lol... I would rather have nothing and be at peace with myself than have everything and be a miserable human being.... a cup of tea and a cool breeze on my face is worth more to me than anything hollywood could ever offer...thats a fact...
Hahaha little she knows that staying at home it is a job too. A 24/7 work plus work. Precious and fulfilling 🧡
Oh my. How sad. At first the arrogance assaults one, then one thinks of her coming fate if something in her heart doesn&#39;t change. Sad. I pray for her salvation, in the name of Yeshua Messiah.<br>Amen<br>PS.<br>I&#39;m not a &quot;religious&quot; person either.
Sorry but twelve years ain’t that long…. Give advice when you are 20 plus in…
She probably has an eating disorder, but definitely not anorexia. I&#39;d say she probably has a binge eating disorder, where she can&#39;t control how much she eats. Binge-eating disorder is a condition where people lose control of their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food. Unlike bulimia, periods of binge eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge eating disorders are often overweight or obese. I heard her say at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTJ4EfkalNQ&amp;t=3m35s">3:35</a> (roughly) that she won&#39;t eat all day and then binge at night, which is common in binge eating disorder and bulimia. So IMO, it&#39;s not anorexia, but probably another ED.
I wonder what they&#39;d think of me. I, medically, cannot gain weight. I wonder if I&#39;d give off major &#39;fatphobic&#39; vibes for something i can&#39;t control.
The fact that Ashley is thick and likes to workout is very attractive... I love me some Ashley 😍😍😍
freedom of speech grown up .
Yea it’s not that gross when women you don’t know have hairy pits, most men have hairy pits I mean if she was a attractive model yea it’d be weird but not something to trip over.
I&#39;m know this is a 3 year old video, but boy does it ever hit me hard. I&#39;m trying to keep to 1200 calories per day, and feel so guilty when I don&#39;t, and relieved when I do. I check all labels for calories and sugar and it just consumes my life to lose weight. I&#39;m an emotional eater too.
White chocolate is very temperamental it can’t get to hot or it gets thick and never! Add anything to it to soften it other than crisco
No James your not fugly
I tend to Boredom eating. Not much of a going out kinda person so it&#39;s get boring n when bored I tend to overeat. And when watching reels of eating food then hunger automatically comes. Which is like fake hunger not the actual one
Ok while the weight loss is great... why hasn&#39;t she done anything about not having teeth? She has so much success and more than enough money to fix them... so why leave your mouth mushy?
&#39;Is the chair fatphobic?&#39; is my current favourite quote ever haha
You’re one of my comfort YouTubers so I keep rewatching these videos over time. I didn’t realize it the first time watching, but now I can see that it’s so obvious that something similar was going on with my ex best friend and me. The way Tammy speaks reminds me so much of her suddenly and especially the way she speaks about Amy is kinda similar to how this „friend“ spoke about me. <br>In my case it wasn’t about weight loss but about psychological issues and how one handles their trauma. It always kinda felt like a competition, like who had the worst trauma, who was the bigger victim… she openly told me she was jealous of me many times and also how my trauma must not have been as bad as hers or else I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish the things I have. (Which, I don’t have an amazing life with tons of accomplishments. I struggle with depression and everyday is a fight for survival sometimes, but I’m not gonna give up on life and work really hard to maintain a somewhat hopeful mindset and I’m really grateful to still be here) she always blamed someone or something else for her failures, even when it was absolutely clear, that sometimes it was just the consequences of her behavior and she felt entitled to everything cause she had it so hard and everyone was out to get her, supposedly. It really hurt, seeing my friend so unhappy and I was trying everything to be supportive but I struggle with my own issues and have a limited capacity. When I told her this, she completely exploded and to this day is convinced that I am/was actively trying to sabotage her.<br>But somehow it makes sense now why she is that way. Im glad to have herbeizubringende my life but I don’t hate her and I really wish her all the best and hopefully one day she will be able to self reflect about her behavior and create a happier life for herself.
It&#39;s kinda sad because people set really low calorie goals and expect to not be hungry like 1200 calories for an overweight person is not realistic for weight loss
Just bought a chubby liner. Going to try it tomorrow.  I have oily skin.  The liners always bleed.  The only one that never does is the Maybelline ultra liquid waterproof eyeliner in black.  Love it.  Won&#39;t try no other. They all bleed.
Thank you kiana. I was struggling with attitude perserverence and positive thinkong my whole life. Watching your videos was an eye openner. I finally believe in my self and I will do my best to lose weight. Thank you so much!
Gross 😮
Our mantra was &quot;keep her off the pole&quot;. It was after a documentary showing the link between a lack of fatherly love and strippers. So if my partner was behaving in a less than ideal way...I&#39;d just quietly say &quot;keep her off the pole&quot;. He&#39;d know exactly what I meant and adjust immediately 😅 It must have worked, because she&#39;s now nearly 19, with a lovely boyfriend and is training to be a nurse. 🎉🎉🎉
It&#39;s so gross.  I cannot stand Ticks.  Yuck🤑
As a doctor I all I can say is my experience is that people often lack the education necessary to identify the reasons why they don’t succeed. They also are deeply sad or frustrated most of the time, which needs addressing first. Plus, when 40% of chronic obesity is due to undiagnosed ADHD, they need to be screened for this and treated if appropriate because they aren’t going to lose any weight of their brain drives them to eat all the time.
Of course it was...I dont see any heroin users positivity,just because like pronoting fat positivity, is not healty...AT ALL!
I have different problem, I east small amounts every hour. I can&#39;t eat like full plate of food and then I get hungry very fast. Only happens in UK, when I leaved in Europe I had no problems keeping my healthy weight even eating sweets everyday.
beautiful... two chubby white girls... MONEY... any chubby black girl... poverty/diabetes/disrespected...<br><br><br>good times...
I found that exercise doesn&#39;t help me lower my appetite at all. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite. I started going to the gym regularly about two months ago, I eat more that I did, healthier than I did, and god am I hungry all the time! Now I just consider it a way to allow myself more calories while not gaining weight
When you are lifting weights concentrate on pushing your bellybutton to your spine. Concentrate on your core. This will help with your neck issue.
it&#39;s the same thing for people who are underweight anorexic too. Many of them will say &quot;I&#39;m healthy&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s a lifestyle&quot;, or even &quot;I&#39;m not underweight&quot;-- or worse &quot;I&#39;m fat!&quot; They don&#39;t believe they&#39;re withering away. They believe they&#39;re the most obese person in the room. Eating disorders are all like that, based in self-deception and delusion. It&#39;s also just like a food addiction, only on the opposite end of the spectrum. Instead of lying to others that they&#39;re on a diet, anorexic nervosa patients will lie that they did eat, and they&#39;ll lie to you, me, their parents, their doctors, everyone. The real question is... how does one even talk to someone who is delusional (whether they&#39;re deluded into not believing their overweight or underweight)? How does one get them to see that they&#39;re severely underweight, that they need help, or that they can die at any moment because of it? I don&#39;t know the answer. All I know is that it&#39;s sad. For many addicts that recover, sometimes it&#39;s not even a matter of hitting &quot;rock bottom&quot;. They say that addicts will change when they want to change.  So how can we even begin to help anorexic or obese people see their unhealthiness? Delusions are just that-- no amount of data or proof will undo a delusion. The person themself will have to be the one to overcome it. I don&#39;t know one person on this planet that knows how to hurry up that &quot;overcome delusion&quot; process, though, in order to save lives.
I’m an obese 12 year old girl and it’s so difficult to live 😔 my obesity makes me feel depressed, unloved and (very very much) a financial burden to my mom
god damnit i am crying ugly tears at tammy&#39;s &quot;i sure the hell did!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m worth it!&quot; she was so sad and hurt and didn&#39;t value her life before i feel like an old friend conquered a terminal illness fr omfg. YES TAMMY
Jesus. dude. You are showing you&#39;re ultimate thicko right here. Mouthing off at an angle that doesn&#39;t apply to the subjects you comment on. TRY HARDER.
Obese people doesn’t understand they are exchanging their lives with food
Fatty protests too much me thinks
Just disgusting
Never knee how to describe it to someone how i still felt &quot;fat&quot; in my now healthy body but you said it the best in here! Thanks 😊
Disgusting. I lost my appetite entirely.
honestly never watched a video of that dude and seeing this now I only find it disturbing and gross...can&#39;t understand how people enjoy this kind of content.
😠 Fat camp should be for the parents not for Children, to learn how to feed their kids, support and encourage them emotionally and become more active and avoid pitfalls.
Can u do a commentary on someone who lost tons and tons of  weight and....gained it back?
Holy crap. I am a type 1 Diabetic and I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s actually endocrinology why I see my blood sugar tank when I&#39;m cooking a meal I&#39;m really anticipating and I&#39;m &quot;starving&quot; by the time I finally sit down. I&#39;ve learned to be careful not to overeat on accident. I&#39;m one of those people, I guess. I have a continuous glucose monitor and it&#39;s been wild watching the patterns over the last three years after drastically changing my lifestyle. Let&#39;s just say I took my a1C from a 10 to a 6.0. My other stat I&#39;m proud of is going from 260 lbs to 180, and still going. I&#39;m also frankly disappointed in my care team for never giving me half as much information as was contained in this video. I had to figure out that high glycemic index foods spike my blood sugar myself and do research on what foods wouldn&#39;t on my own. I got there eventually. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m healthier now at 35 than I was at 25 😉 Thanks for letting me toot my horn a little. Genuinely fantastic video!
&quot;I have no control over what he eats&quot; bs...you buy the food...you can lock the cupboards, you control the portion size, ...yeah, you can control what the kid eats!
Not only that how is taking care of yourself fatphobic . Now I could see if she started running around calling everyone fat but she didn&#39;t or hasn&#39;t. She only referenced her own health and body
Diet is gross.
ive started watching this show on youtube recently and had to stop. they had little segments in between that were painful to watch and put unhealthy thoughts into my head. they had segments focusing on anorexia and right after have segments of a perfectly healthy normal looking woman doing everything she can to get &#39;quick fix&#39; solutions to acheive the body shape she wanted. she&#39;d talk about her flabby tummy and &#39;rotund belly&#39; without even a morsel of pudge on her, going from workout place to workout place, even doing laser lipo treatments! so on one hand it&#39;s &#39;quick fix weightloss is bad&#39; and then on the other &#39;here&#39;s some quick fix weight loss tips!&#39;. i found myself kind of obsessing over the people with EDs and what they would do to lose weight, paying hyper attention to the superskinnies. putting that in my youtube algorithm is actually what made your videos start showing up n my feed, so in a way im grateful, but yeah, i can&#39;t watch that show anymore!
OK the video was probably wrong but don’t bring back bullying that’s horrible imagine going to school every day having multiple bullies bully you having the whole world bully you do you know how much suicides would come back if you want to bring back bling that’s disgusting
Someone who has used bad habits their whole life, shows they are ON TRACK to use those bad habits for the rest of their life.  Let&#39;s not get into the well super fat is ok, but oh not super, super fat!  Maybe if we stopped apologizing for the truth, more people would be happier, and alive!!!
Just saw the documentary. It was fascinating to see a part of my childhood deconstructed like that. Still, I&#39;m not sure I agree with the general idea that the backlash against the brand and the effects are &quot;good&quot;. <br>First of all, there wasn&#39;t really any karmic punishment here. There was no comeuppance. The man was making 40 million a year for a while and then quit working with a 27 million dollar retirement payout. He won. He&#39;s a winner. Second, while I definitely agree that certain aspects of the company needed to come under scrutiny and needed to be eliminated (the treatment of the models or the sexualization of teenagers, for instance), I don&#39;t think trying to force the brand to cater to everyone at the risk of being destroyed by public outcry was a good strategy. <br>Abercrombie was built on one idea of what the ideal All-American look/lifestyle is. People who disagreed with that idea, who found themselves excluded from it for their skin color, religion, or body shape could have come together to build a new brand that took the same idea and expressed it in a way that was inclusive, without trying to force the notion that the traditional, very conservative, very preppy, very white idea of Americana needs to die. Why? Why can&#39;t the people who still feel that way have businesses that cater to them? Why isn&#39;t there room for more than one idea of American identity? <br>If you don&#39;t feel like a business fits you, take your money elsewhere. Why do you have to actively try to destroy it so you can feel validated at all times in all places by all people? Like, I know Chick-fil-A doesn&#39;t like me. I know it doesn&#39;t want my business. I&#39;m not going to picket to try to force them to do it, I&#39;m just going to buy my chicken elsewhere. Will I let other people know about the things I disagree with about Chick-fil-A? Sure. But if they choose to still go there, I&#39;m not going to cry about it and start a protest.
Aww as a big girl, I LOVE this episode and I love the fact that Christian designs for big girls as well. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m dressing up because the way plus size clothes STILL are like a one-size-fits-all way. Designers assume all big girls have big boobs or big arms or huge legs that I look like I&#39;m swimming in a lot of the clothes I wear, and it&#39;s embarrassing! But Christian gets it. Love this episode so much ♥️
I am always saying that Neil deGrasse Tyson is NOT a scientinst, he is just a showman, america likes him much because he is speaking what they want to hear, nothing else.<br>But this debate proves that he is not smart enough to compete with Shapiro.<br>Also we segregate sport FOR A OBVIOUS reason, one of this reason is fairness in competition. That is why we have categories, so people on similiar level can compete against each other.<br>For example: Sex category, weight category, age category...<br><br>Anyways during whole dabate Neil deGrasse Tyson is avoiding precise discussion and and only jump from one topic to another.
Thank God it&#39;s gone. The fashion industry contributes to so much pollution and environmental hazard and waste, not too mention the exploitation. When big corporations fail, an angel gets its wings. Also, why do you hate fat people?
Fat Food
What does idiot and know that God is often referred to as father.  My father, who’s thout in heaven.<br>I am a father and the last time I checked I do have a penis. Therefore God has a penis.
your point about food apps absolutely resonates with me, even if I have no eating or weight issues. though I wfr and the temptation of ordering so easily, specially in the busy work week, is huge. I do order regularly but try my best to regulate and choose healthier options.<br>I live in a country where food apps are still an expensive delivery choice and fast-food isn&#39;t seen as standard food for lunch or dinner. we can order packed lunch in the apps, which helps me a lot to order health food for more than a day, but boy. it does take a conscious effort and I feel it.
Some fat titties! A compliment btw!
It’s because they’re allowed to “sample” whatever food they want at stores &amp; people are too scared to stop them for fear of losing their jobs &amp; they know they can not show up for work &amp; still be on the schedule. They’re given an easy path for promotions giving them access to higher pay which means more food. Pretty much the only time that they’re not overweight is when they’re only fed prison food, they’re a basketball or football player, or they’re on crack
Lose weight..easy, STOP EATING.So I am something of a health nut, have been since my teens, what is common knowledge to me is surprisingly not know by many.<br><br>And the scary thing is. when you get down to it, in most stores 90% of what is on the shelves is trash, I mean actual trash. it won&#39;t provide you with vitamins, nutrients fibers or proteins.<br><br>if you don&#39;t have an active lifestyle, and a slow metabolism. you basically have to eat high protein low sugar diets. I am a 6,2 muscular male, and because my job is sedentary I eat  aprox 1800 calories a day (supplemented by vitamins). and that is enough to maintain my 90kg weight, anything above 2300, and I start to gain slowly, but steadily.<br><br>You have to think, you have to exercise control, because anything non-fresh, is usually bad (bad meaning low nutrient density). you must read all the labels, stuff that seems fine like &quot;meatballs&quot; could have as little as 30% actual meat in it.<br><br>its actually crazy, you have a whole isle for different crisps, but only a small section for fresh foods.
Maybe its not that you hate fat people, but hate that fat people suffer for being fat. There&#39;s a lot of complicated emotional/brain stuff there.
Can u do a commentary on someone who lost tons and tons of  weight and....gained it back?
I felt bad for Daniel for a long time because his father stole his inheritance money, until I researched more about his grandfather. Allen’s father was actually the biggest gangster in Australia for decades, so that inheritance was obviously blood money.
Hm I don&#39;t agree with many points here. Because a &quot;controlled&quot; Binge eating IS having control. The most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when the blood sugar drops so much that it&#39;s a body&#39;s mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things. But the thing you said with school is a whole different topic. For a diet it&#39;s bad, but for keeping your weight it&#39;s good.<br><br>I did this most of my school time while having hashimoto (which means my metabolismn is so bad that I get weight fast and lose weight hard) but I had my rule , first of all I never in my life eating breakfast if I have to wake up early, I had rule that if I have 6 hours school I eat and drink nothing during that time, if I have longer like 8 or 9 hours I will eat one apple. And this I continued like 7 years (?) and - it was fine. In the evening I ate tons of trash , huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly. Because it was like remaining in control during the day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy, and in evening you reward yourself for it. And I never gained any kg of weight during all the years. Of course I didn&#39;t lose neither, but also not gained weight. <br><br>So I disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar.
Intentional Weight Loss Doesn&#39;t work? I&#39;m an even 6 in height. <br>At 18 I was a literal skeleton with skin and weighed 165lbs, at 30 I was 242lbs and quite fat. <br>Now at 32 I am 171lbs simply by cutting excess food and walking instead of taking the car or bus. <br>These people have no accountability and blame everything on society instead of introspecting.
If you&#39;re hungry that means your body is burning fat calories. That&#39;s your goal, to lose weight. Not to keep stuffing food in your fat face. You ain&#39;t never going to be nothing but a morbidly obese slob.
I&#39;d say I&#39;m liberally republican. I believe in the Republican values, but I also share some sentiments with true liberals (to clarify, non-radical). <br><br>We need a strong basis for the country, but there does need to be some change in the system about the little things to appease the people such as legalizing weed and giving back rights to certain freedoms we have been restrained from, such as the &quot;fighting words&quot; basis.
Although Tammy&#39;s mentality is obviously wrong, I think too many people are blaming her or seeing it as her fault. It&#39;s not her fault for having fears and doubts, especially when she&#39;s so dependent on food. I think she needed to have some kind of reassurance or therapy before she started the weight loss journey
For almost my entire life, I’ve struggled with eating disorders and being underweight. Starting when I was around five or six I weighed about 50 to 60 pounds  and stayed almost that exact weight, even losing about 5 to 10 pounds on and off until I was about 10 or 11. Even then, when I was well aware that I was underweight, I was still freaking out about being overweight and fat and needing to lose weight. I am now 13 and still struggle with that, but I am much better now.
I couldn&#39;t disagree more with the notion that you should feel good about your body when it is manifestly not attractive to consensus reality. This is just another form of delusion. I am HAPPY that I have a voice in my head that will say &quot;hey you&#39;ve put on 8 lb, better knock off the sudden fat intake!&quot; or &quot;great, now it&#39;ll take 4-5 days to fully get rid of that chick parm sandwich and 3 slices if pizza you ate when drunk because alcohol makes you do stupid things with food&quot; or &quot;get your ass to the gym now bubba!&quot;....That self-denigration is EARNED. Prancing around in a nikini when you&#39;re over 400 lb and telling yourself it&#39;s all normal is just more delusion.
OMG yes it was totally my dream to go to fat camp as a child as well! I wasn&#39;t even particularly fat, just demonstrably not the skinny child my parents wanted me to be.
“Today we’re gonna try something new and no I don’t mean your father”<br>I wheezed-
Where are the creations for short women and men? This is a big lie about his so-called size diversity. He is a short man, and when was the last time you saw him feature a short woman or man on the runway?
If you haven&#39;t eaten for 6 hours....you&#39;re not &quot;starving&quot;.  You&#39;re just plain old hungry.  That&#39;s it.  Starving is when your body fat percentage drops so low that your body begins to snack on your muscle and organ tissue.  It&#39;s pretty much a guarantee that anyone who is dieting will never be &quot;starving&quot; if they weigh more than the number of the Marine Corps Height/Weight chart. We need to stop using language like &quot;starving&quot;.  And people who are fat need to get comfortable with feeling hungry.  People need to have enough self discipline that they overpower their ghrelin.  They need to be able to say to it... &quot;Who&#39;s in charge here?  Me...or you?&quot;  And then take charge and do what needs to be done.  Abstain from eating until the chosen time.
I just wanna follow up on my previous comment (and again I realize I&#39;m talking about being TOO SKINNY but...I think this applies, because:)<br><br>My parents always tried to FORCE ME TO EAT, and then gave in when I refused, or sent me to bed as a kid, or would say they&#39;d take something away and I wanted bed that night anyway...<br><br>Things actually changed when they OFFERED me dinner and it was OPTIONAL. I could eat my frozen meal...Or if I like what they were cooking I could join them and...IT WAS TOTALLY MY CHOICE. Eventually, in this environment, this was when I decided it wouldn&#39;t hurt (In fact it would HELP) to join them once or twice a week since my dad always cooks fresh..OR AT LEAST HEALTHIER THAN WHAT I EAT... Options.<br><br>The Fat Kids need that. An OFFER. A CHANCE. Thankfully my parents DID eventually realize keeping me at the table wasn&#39;t the answer. They set &quot;deals&quot; for me as a child. And as an adult they always ask how much I will ACTUALLY eat (And I eat any leftovers the next day).<br><br>This seems nuts but I used to be able see my ribs (SLIGHTLY. I wasn&#39;t starving.) Now I have an actual belly that jiggles a little bit...)<br><br>But if only these kids parents WOULD OFFER THEIR KIDS AN OPTION. Or I guess In this case...LET THE KIDS OFFER THEM AN OPTION!<br><br>My dad is the cook in house BUT he DID GIVE US CHANCES and while me and my youngest brother blew ours, my middle brother actually DOES cook for our Dad, and even sometimes gets the honor of being his Sous Chef. To be fair though my dad DOES let ME make the green bean casserole for Thanksgiving (He always browns the Fries Onions a Little too much and for some reason THAT dish is one of two dishes I can TOTALLY NAIL..)
very good and informative video, Kiana! I&#39;m seeking advice in the following: I&#39;m 17 years old, have circled through various disordered eating patterns for the past 4 years (binging, purging and restricting cycles), tried intermittent fasting up to 50 hours, counted calories and tried every diet. i&#39;m at a healthy weight now and in recovery from restricting and started HRT (testosterone) maybe 6 months ago. Everything came crashing down on my body since then and I&#39;ve had some intense changes in my appetite and metabolism (that is expected on T HRT, but i&#39;m struggling to manage my eating habits). I try to not eat a lot more than I have before but my cortisol is at an all time high. I&#39;m very active (taking care of various animals and also endurance running) and I&#39;m so so scared of gaining weight. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with severe hypoglycemia(on the verge of vomiting) and have to eat even though i have had dinner (veggies, fiber, protein, slow carbs) maybe 4-5hrs prior. My sugar keeps crashing multiple times a day and Ive come close to collapsing from hypoglycemia multiple times even though I eat normally moderate portions 4 times a day(no fast food, lots of fruit and veg, oatmeal, whole grain, greek yogurt, lean meat, white rice). Is there anyone who has any advice or anything? I&#39;m desperate for anything.
Maybe we have a different recipe in my country, but Diet Coke is just disgusting and it’s not popular at all
If I were her sister, I&#39;d lock her in a room and give her a strict as all hell diet until she loses weight. Once she&#39;s able to walk on her own, I&#39;d leave. That&#39;s it. She&#39;s an adult. She can take care of herself after that. I would literally be so done with her so quickly
I wonder what they&#39;d think of me. I, medically, cannot gain weight. I wonder if I&#39;d give off major &#39;fatphobic&#39; vibes for something i can&#39;t control.
Children children...<br><br> Some people are gonna be fat. They like food and they like sitting. That is all. That has always been all there is to it.<br><br>Stop looking for a goddamn institutional problem that would be responsible for people enjoying the burgers a little too much ! <br><br>This boogeyman of racism is a huge distraction to the new generations. They don&#39;t even understand things that have always been.
I was born in Slovenia, it’s ex Yugoslavian country thats been independent since 1991,  and fully joined EU in 2003. <br>We were part of Socialist regime before and very fast adopted  western capitalism. <br>On paper everything was state owned before but in practice workers were the real owners of every factory, of every business. <br>Salary gap between a CEO of a company and a cleaner in the company were not as crazy as today.<br>One example is (and I’m talking this from my own experiences, from being a kid and teenager growing up in that regime)<br>My father was a electrician for a big curtain factory and my mother was a sales person in a grocery store. At the end of the year, when the business made more money then expected both of my parents received part of that money and every summer we went on a one month vacation in Croatia where accommodation was 100% payed by the company. These summer houses were owned by government/workers so they got to use them. <br>My childhood memories were beautiful with my parents not being overworked as they became after. These vacations were modest, no 5 starts hotels and so, its Croatian places that are now being rented for 200€ per night.<br>Something that now 90% of the Slovenian, Croatian families simply can never afford.<br><br>With Slovenia becoming independent and my parents being very motivated to create something of their own. They started their own business in 90s with the money that was quite easy to save during Socialistic times. They started with opening one “Car parts store” and eventually added 4 more over the years. We were financially doing very well, i guess you could say we were rich. My parents were extremely hard working and smart with money. They build their own house, out if the city and even bought 2 big apartments that would supposed to be for me and my brother. So looking from outside everything was great, but the quality of life went extremely downhill, my parents were overworked, those one month vacations were gone, simply because there was no time for that, if we could squeeze 6 days per year it was already a lot.<br>With parents being overworked, health problems occurred (thankfully we didn’t adopted western healthcare practices, even now going to doctor is practically for free)<br>My parents were stressed, working 6 days per week, my 7 years younger brother had the luxury of getting a lot of material things and opportunities that i hasn’t ( he started a lot of hobbies that he never followed trough) but he missed on having happy parents that had time for him, like for instance I had. Even though he had much more things I definitely consider myself as a lucky one. <br><br>Fast forward to today. Due to globalisation and foreign corporations majoring of Slovenian businesses went bankrupt or were simply bought up by businesses from richer countries. <br>Small country with less than 2 million of population on the border of Europe union simply cannot compete with richer, bigger, more established countries of EU.  <br><br>One of the biggest problems national problems based in my opinion is housing crisis. Prices are the same as for instance in Germany, where I live now for 6 years.<br>Except that the average salary is 800€ net while in Germany is 2300€ net. <br>Even with very poor calculation skills you can determine that anyone owning and paying of an apartment in their lifetime in Slovenia is practically impossible. <br><br>This is my explanation of Socialism based on the experiences I collected while growing up in a very interested era, the conversion from Socialism to what I call “the disease that will end humanity - mother and father of Evil - Capitalism”
I’m fatphobic about my own body but don’t give a shit about others. I’ve had chronic hip pain for 8 years. It’s only gotten better this year after I lost 23 kilo. I’m terrified of getting bigger again because I don’t wanna be in pain like that again
Gross 😝
They should make a show where an overweight person spends an entire week with a healthy weight person eating and exercising exactly what the healthy person does!  I suspect the overweight person will feel like they are being starved and cannot keep up with the exercise!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTLe9kBfO4c&amp;t=9m53s">9:53</a> The HYPOCRISY of saying that these shows degrade people and teach children that those who suffer from obesity are freaks and outcasts, only to say later on that Ableism in “comedy” performances are ‘funny and acceptable’ is truly disgusting; imagine how people that have Special Needs feel when they are ostracized and deemed ‘unwanted’ in any form of media.
I think they have interpreted the science a little wrong.<br>After a very hard &amp; intense glycolytic work out you are significantly more insulin sensitive. In this state the body is better prepared to handle a meal containing simple carbohydrates with high glycemic index, with out causing a spike in blood sugar and insulin as glucose is more easily directed into skeletal muscle.<br>So if you eat healthily all week a hard work out before a big Sunday lunch can help to<br>off set the carbohydrate load<br>It does not mean that you can  get away with devouring  3 pizzas and a few tubs of Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s after a just a 25 minutes on the elliptical machine .
I feel like it&#39;s always the positive, bubbly and optimistic people who can laugh at themselves and are honest with themselves who are the ones succeeding in these massive weight loss journeys.
Wait! U look a lot like the make up person in the Disney plus show called proud family or smthing
Fattieboomba
if she went from regular to diet soda then she coukd lose lots of weight and still enjoy her soda
Thank you so much for your excellent content! I&#39;m trying to figure out how long the word weight loss journey has been used. It seems like I&#39;ve only heard of it recently. I much prefer the word that you used in the video story. to me a journey implies an ending. Yes, Once you get down to your goal weight, then I guess your weight loss journey has ended. But story seems to encompass that my healthy eating plan is something that needs to  continue for the rest of my life , and I&#39;ll have to continue to watch for regain.
Tammy is disgusting🤮🤢
When rosie talked about the weight after giving birth, that&#39;s my life now and I love that she said tht I&#39;m so thankful
I am fat, I was even more fat, but I started eating a little less, and I lost weight.<br>Objectivly speaking, eat less, lose weight. If you have mental problems and dont fix that, you&#39;ll eat it right back, but eat less lose weight
Honestly there are not so fat people in britain at all by a long shot. I never saw a really huge obese person in california but i saw really enormous people and i had never in my life seen such peopke in the uk. There are some obese peopke and some fat people for sure but i never saw anything like what i saw in california it was amazing and mind blowing ...i had to try not to stare but my eyes would just be drawn and my jaw would just drop completely because i had never seen anything like it. And i believe california isnt as bad as other usa
Animal fats dont make you fat, they make you healthy, its the greains and crap,. Also maybe you should have mentioned the gene they have that help them to put on fat at an amazing rate. This help pacific islanders make the most of good times for the lean times.
You lay down with another person of opposite sex, and engage in the exchange of bodily fluids...the result may very well be pregnancy. <br>  You willingly engaged in the act, unless forced, then I stand with you...if not<br>  There is no &quot;get out of parenthood free card&quot; for the mother, like there is none for the father
OMG !! What a disgusting 🤢 🤮freak
I bought the summer Friday mini lip butter balm set and I’m considering going to their website to get the full size trip because I love them so much. Then I also bought the Laura Mercier blush trio, which I think I like so far, along with the hourglass jellyfish palette I am in love with
Kiana! Video suggestion: how intuitive eating doesn&#39;t work for obese people because their satiety mechanism is and food intuition mechanisms are shot and the evidence is plain for everyone to see. That awful fat positivity song talking about listening to their bodies is a joke.
I‘m a Chinese, It&#39;s funny to see you guys in the west culture go through this madness era, If Mr Oppenheimer alive, He will be forced to make fireworks for the BLM LGBTQplus，your liberals are going too far left, 😀
&quot;This meat isn&#39;t sold i any other country!&quot;<br><br>Meat and fat doesn&#39;t cause obesity. Sugar and carbs does.<br><br>Carnivore diet is a panacea!
sO yOu tHiNk iM sKiNny got me laughing so hard😂😂
My family is full of bad marriages. My grandfather beat the shit out of my grandmother. Grandma was glad when he died but she had to raise 5 kids on her own. My father ,repeats the same behaviour as his father. Throughout my childhood and teenage years , my parents fought. My father would come home drunk and beat my mom. They are still married but not happy. Its more cordial now. My blood boils when he acts normal as if nothing happend earlier. When you present marriage to a person, i&#39;d rather stay away. I can barely talk to guy. I dont even makeup or dress pretty. My inner child is still struggling. I&#39;d rather die alone than be with a wife beater or a narcissist. How do you sell this idea of marriage to me?
i absolutely love how he includes plus size, i would love to have his clothes if i could afford them.
Bru the one size was an 11/10 when it literally smudged😂
I have super thick brows. I don’t do much (or anything) on the daily but for full glam, a bit of pencil and something to add hold, so about 5 minutes? Also I have a stupendous brow lady and she keeps be legit.
It’s not that she doesn’t want to give up overeating and smoking, it’s that she wants to keep her self harm. We assume that as a species we always want to live and thrive, but that’s not necessarily the case.
Google employees are really about to be losing all kinds of weight with the layoffs.
I always love your videos! L’Oreal also has some new skinny bullet lipsticks. I haven’t tried them yet but I’m so curious about how they perform.
Alot of people in the Pacific had diets that had the majority of their calories coming from tubers like taro or sweet potatoes.  Their diets were very low in fat.
fat people making fat jokes 👍<br>skinny/healthy people making fat jokes 👎
It kinda grosses me out Shane keeps mentioning he&#39;s sweaty... I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s trying to be funny but... 🤢
Shouldn’t the lip plumper go on first
Prayers for salvation of souls,  these people are selfishly entitled, the world must rotate around the self designated king, And get a pronoun wrong and &quot;off with your head&quot; So ,much hatred, and confusion .The simplest ,basic reality is God made man and woman, man and wife, for creation of family. Again now, you just define your own family.  The world is full of haters ,Satan, the Father of lies is prowling the earth to populate Hell .
Such hideous people......disgusting
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
Although the percentage of obese people in the uk is almost as high as in the USA, as a European from another country, not UK, it seems that there are fewer super morbidly obese people in the uk.  I used to live in the uk and plenty of people are big, but there is lower cut off.  They have far fewer Slatons!  So it&#39;s not for the sake of shade!  In other ways perception of Americans from ny or california is very thin!
For almost 14 years since 2009 when I was 28 I stayed stuck between 285 and sometimes only around as low as 275 at the lightest I was stuck no matter what I Tried I felt like there was no way to lose weight. I thought it was due to my thyroid issue but back then and for a long time moost of my life I grew up on junk food. I don&#39;t honestly think my parents would have put these foods in our bodies if they had known!<br><br>Last Sept I noticed something was gouing up my weight at my heaviest I became 300 for the first time ever. I was beyond depressed, I Felt like I had no real hope. I remember praying for help from God and in late December around Christmas and for a month after I was beyond sick. I think ikt was the flu but it was worse than anything I Had it might have been covid I never got tested I dont &#39;know. But I lost for the first time 34 lbs in one month!<br><br>I found out when I bought some clothes from Victoria secrets I was used to saying that The clothes were too tight it was the first time I saw them loose and too big O_O I was in shock. Around March I think it was God put it on my mind to quit soda that I was badly addicted to then I realized if I&#39;m quitting soda why not chips and candy, I started to see more weight loss a little at a time but I looked a lot thinner because Soda makes you look fatter looking! <br><br>I am at 46 lbs weight lose and i still cant&#39; believe it&#39;s me saying it. I quit chinese food this month cause it made me sick, and I quit pizza and i hate eating out at fast food chains I have actually avoided them as much as possible. But I still ate things that werne&#39;t so great for me. The fact is it&#39;s about forcing yourself to walk away from the things that are not good for you no matter how good they taste. <br><br>I hope and pray tath since I am now quitting bread that I will continue to see the weightloss. I make most of my own meals and I do my best to eat things like whole wheat pasta instaed of the normal one was not filling at all. I also hand cut my own fries and air fry them if I have them, we have a bunch more options between my father and I. I am excited I was 3x now I am large in tees and pjs and in jeans depending on brands 16 to 18!  I would have been 24 in those ones. Anyways again never imagined I could do this. I have never been so grateful to get sick the way I was!<br><br>Don&#39;t give up ever! It&#39;s not worth going back on those. I also avoid cakes and cookies etc. I had no idea about Oreos I&#39;m glad i quit those things. The list is beyond long of what i walked away from and I know that I am going down more and more with each passing day. I Feel beyond healthy! I know I have a long journey ahead but I also know that it&#39;s possible now.l just can&#39;t give up. I wanted to thank you for these videos you made it really clued me in on a lot of things i Did not understand. I am no longer hopeless when it comes to this subject of true health.

If u doctor tells you to lose weight, it&#39;s cuz ur gonna die. That&#39;s not fat phobic.
Revolution seems to have made a perfect dupe of the Miracle Balms , I got 2 shades of the product made by Bobby Brown and it’s exactly what they do. Greasy , sticky , thick , never sinks in.
Fast metabolism buds !! Same! I experience that same exact thing, so I feel you on. Trying to gain weight.
I recently found ur channel bc I was scouring YT for weight loss videos. I love ur content so much! Ur so smart and have such a clear and concise way of communicating ur research. Thank u!
The One Size one performed worse than the ones rated lower. 👀
as someone who is adhd and (was) prediabetic, this is very helpful &lt; 3 im trying to lose weight and understand why i eat the way i do!
They are all stupid and disgusting
The best example that being obese isn&#39;t ok is the sheer amount of people who watch videos like this (and might be reading this) who previously bought into the BoPo slogans that keep you unhealthy and complacent, then said &quot;No more&quot; and &quot;Never again&quot;.<br><br>No amount of rallying the &quot;large and in charge&quot; can persuade people that missing out on your life and your family is worth it.
As a big white guy.......I would like thank and blame myself for the epic late night runs to taco bell. And not enough trips to the gym.....btw it&#39;s my own damn fault but slowly working on it. So I agree with the last guy.....fat people are everywhere and it&#39;s our own fault
Kiana put it best in another video: fat activism in the HAES vein is simply crabs in a bucket syndrome.  How dare anyone in their community better themselves and not stay with the injured herd.
It&#39;s for fat girls only.   Its an extension of the Fat Acceptance movement.  It&#39;s a &quot;Fat Girls Only&quot;  Mean Girls Club.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTLe9kBfO4c&amp;t=9m53s">9:53</a> The HYPOCRISY of saying that these shows degrade people and teach children that those who suffer from obesity are freaks and outcasts, only to say later on that Ableism in “comedy” performances are ‘funny and acceptable’ is truly disgusting; imagine how people that have Special Needs feel when they are ostracized and deemed ‘unwanted’ in any form of media.
And back in the days my mother was like a racer without any preparation, just went into the car, get it ready up and on and drive off like a smooth maniac<br><br>As for my father, we had one time where it took him 10-15 minutes just to get from the parking spot to the gate of the mall which takes only 1-2 minutes if you were to walk there going the same road as the car at the parking spot<br>I love my family
People don&#39;t overeat because they don&#39;t know that overeating is bad. They overeat because they are addicted to the comfort of food. People become addicts because of trauma. They will never stop being fat until they learn a better way to deal with trauma.
A lot of people think that it&#39;s easier to lose weight and eat healthier by eating certain foods and &quot;limiting&quot; junk food, but I have personally found that it&#39;s easier to have at least a general plan for what to eat each day and track all food. It leads me to make food choices based on whether it is worth the calories, both by nutrition and taste (both are important). Evidence that this worked for me: I lost 70 lbs, from 265 to 195 at 6&#39;4&quot;. I did not exercise in any way during this period, although I definitely should have. After I lost the weight I started lifting weights and doing cardio a few times per week and gained back another 25 lbs of lean mass (muscle, water, glycogen) over a year and a half and actually managed to lose more fat mass. Do with this anecdote what you will, but perhaps it will help someone realize there is an approach between trying to make better choices in the moment and complete meal planning.
Im from the Uk. This show Freaky Eaters isn’t good. Neither is SuperSkinny v Supersized.
Omg . This is stupid .all ppl are fat including myself are due to not eating healthy . Lil or no exercise.
We live in a world of excess food and it&#39;s food that creates obesity with sugar and carbohydrates. Unfortunately everyone including the medical world are ignorant and believe the food pyramid is healthy when it was designed by the US Dept of Agriculture to increase sales of wheat, corn, etc. Those parents who are deliberately undermining their kids efforts and destroying their lives are disgusting and I really wanted to kick their arses.
&quot;That&#39;s kinda what we are designed for.&quot; Excuse me? What exactly is it you want to imply here. This woman is working at home on her podcast promoting women&#39;s safety talking about the for left and how women&#39;s rights are being taken away. Are you forgetting that back before electricity was invented everything was made by hand. The women were working they just did it by pretty much making everything the family needed that the husband would never do in his entire life. Plus nurses female nurses that were the closest things to female doctors also existed. It is something that has always existed. Mid wife&#39;s don&#39;t forget hand maids female slaves. Seamstresses and female politicians in royalty. Not to mention elders and nuns any other kind of work that women were able to get. It all depended mostly on their education and class pretty much. You can&#39;t afford education if you have to pay for it and you are poor. No one stops to think about that do they? Be grateful for you got today ladies. If you do not then history is doomed to repeat.
“Why are you so ugly?” <br>“I don’t know!!”<br><br>Love you so much jeffree shine bright queen ❤️
Why is this woman so fat?
Omg whyy!?!?! Get that disgusting piercing out of your beautiful face!
Thank God it&#39;s gone. The fashion industry contributes to so much pollution and environmental hazard and waste, not too mention the exploitation. When big corporations fail, an angel gets its wings. Also, why do you hate fat people?
I believe fat people think that the food they eat is more satisfying and tasty than eating healthily. And eating healthily means eating food they don’t like or even find disgusting. But eating healthily IS more tasty, more fun, makes you feel better and satisfy you because you’re getting the nutrients you need. It gives you more energy to put that mental effort into choosing healthy. Work out how you can make eating healthily part of every day and eventually everything you eat. We are so lucky to have the internet that makes it easy to find healthy, tasty and quick recipes. Also have one or two easy fall-back meals for when you can’t be bothered to choose. For me that is chicken, rice and broccoli (swap out broccoli) for whatever vegetable you like if you don’t like broccoli.
Wtf who beats their kid over makeup….I literally thought that was a joke that’s freaking disgusting.
They don&#39;t have to relinquish power. They have to be forced out. No one should be there for more than eight years and there should be no grandfathering. As for John Fetterman, he&#39;s just plain retarded
She is a disgusting human being! Activists like this should never hold office!
freddy was doing the most to keep her fat even like taking the fall for her on lies<br>you think he might have a feeder fetish?
They know exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re just lying to avoid accountability. Disgusting.
Fat parents tend to raise fat kids. The parents fail because they&#39;re full of sad excuses. They blame the air for being too cold to go for a walk, blame not having enough time, and blame others for something. Fat people never take on their own responsibility. It&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault they&#39;re fat.
That’s gross 🤮 keep it to yourself lady
Sooooo now all the muscular torsos moved to Instagram where they get massive following …. Glad k was never ugly and sanctimonious ….
Why don&#39;t women stop breeding with ugly men? I guess someone&#39;s gotta pay the bills
the tea confiscated my tub of cocoa butter for being a tiny bit oversized
Not me bawling at Amy crying at getting weight loss surgery…<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whoscuttingonions">#whoscuttingonions</a>
lolol girl shows a picture of when she is a little bit chubby and says she knows how it is to be fat.. laaaawl.. wtf
Hm I don&#39;t agree with many points here. Because a &quot;controlled&quot; Binge eating IS having control. The most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when the blood sugar drops so much that it&#39;s a body&#39;s mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things. But the thing you said with school is a whole different topic. For a diet it&#39;s bad, but for keeping your weight it&#39;s good.<br><br>I did this most of my school time while having hashimoto (which means my metabolismn is so bad that I get weight fast and lose weight hard) but I had my rule , first of all I never in my life eating breakfast if I have to wake up early, I had rule that if I have 6 hours school I eat and drink nothing during that time, if I have longer like 8 or 9 hours I will eat one apple. And this I continued like 7 years (?) and - it was fine. In the evening I ate tons of trash , huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly. Because it was like remaining in control during the day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy, and in evening you reward yourself for it. And I never gained any kg of weight during all the years. Of course I didn&#39;t lose neither, but also not gained weight. <br><br>So I disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar.
My 20-year-old niece keeps gaining weight and doesn’t care. Her mother can’t mention the weight gain or she yells back - don’t body shame me. Dangerous, selfish message.
the weight you lose would be the money in your pocket
I honestly don&#39;t see the appeal of mukbangs in general, and Nikocado&#39;s channel in particular. The eating is just gross, and even if you found it entertaining, if he does this every day, doesn&#39;t it get boring really quickly? Secondly, it seems impossible to know what&#39;s genuine with this guy.
This obese influencer is a grifter . She could easily lose weight if she lost her sense of taste.
Such exaggeration that fat people  cancelled Abercrombie it was in bad state after the great recession in 2008. As it was to expensive for the average teenager or young person.Bud light is a somewhat modern comparison.
Piers Morgan is real trash... he literally just tried to belittle a fellow reporter, in the heat of the fight, in Gaza.. It was disgusting.  That reporter put him in his place.
I don’t understand the attraction of watching videos of people gorging on piles of disgusting food. It’s so gross 🤮
I had a friend who lost a significant amount of weight. Despite how much I wanted to lose weight, but failing miserably though now I&#39;m down 70 pounds and just a little more to go, I only felt happy for her. While I do wish to be skinny and what not, I just can&#39;t see myself getting upset at someone for putting the work into getting fit. I also want bigger breast but I don&#39;t hate my friends who have a bigger chest than me. I think it also comes down to maturity levels as well. I can&#39;t see a mature person getting that angry and jealous over someone else&#39;s success. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s just what I think. Just because I hate my body and self, doesn&#39;t mean that I wouldn&#39;t want someone else to stay unhealthy either. That&#39;s just weird. I took my issue and turned it into motivation to try to get me to lose weight. I just want to finally feel pretty, or at least don&#39;t feel like a whale. I probably will always feel that way but still. That and I want to find a man who will love me, even though I know it&#39;s a far fetched fantasy. It&#39;s so far beyond fantasy that it&#39;s not even in the realm of any world.
The Darkstar (hypersonic aircraft shown in the beginning of the movie) may not be a real plane, but it certainly looks like a part of it—so much so that the Navy told Top Gun producer, and legendary filmmaker, Jerry Bruckheimer, that China is reorienting its spy satellite to catch a glimpse of their full-size clone designed to filming. The Navy said that &quot;The Chinese satellite turned and took a different route to photograph the plane. They thought it was real. That&#39;s how it really looks like,” Bruckheimer told Sandboxx News.
I just watched this movie last night and I was disgusted by it. “Your friendly neighborhood - call a social worker - Spider-Man… The entire story could have been avoided by Peter being rational and sending them back to their timelines. I did not like the woke “but I can fix them,” or “everyone deserves a second chance.” How’d that work out for May? What other problems did he cause in the multiverse by changing fate. The motto is “With great power, comes great responsibility.” What about the responsibility in altering fate in other universes? Isn’t that an abuse of power to satisfy one’s own selfish need to fix something? That’s irresponsible. Besides that, I did love having all three generations of Spider-Man together, as corny as their lines were at times, it made the movie worth watching.
How many 600 lb actors are there actually? You could not have this film without a fat suit. Like you said expecting an actor to gain that much weight is insane. So, in this situation I am pro fat suit.
I watch no Disney movie ever again. They are corrupt disgusting people
1 cookie will NEVER make anyone fat. A conveyor belt of anything will.
We actually just NEED to turn our Backs On Movies in general!!! If you pay to watch or Buy a Movie You ARE Donating Your Money To The Disgusting Human And Sex Trafficking!!! You Absolutely ARE making it POSSIBLE For These People To Be Able To Commit These Atrocious Acts!!! Stop FUNDING Human/Sex Trafficking!!! Stop FUNDING The Woke Bull Shat!!! You, Reading this, YOUR MONEY IS ABSOLUTELY PAYING FOR THEIR SLAVES AND THEIR TRAFFICKING OF THESE HUMAN SLAVES!!! YOU ARE MAKING IT AFFORDABLE FOR THEM!!! STOP FUNDING THESE POS FOOKWAD WASTES OF OXYGEN!!!
I&#39;m in pretty good shape, my stomach lost it&#39;s six pack and is now just a flat stomach, I have to ride my bike up a moderately steep hill for about a mile after work to get to where I stay so my legs are in good shape, so I guess I&#39;m fatphobic lol, even though I&#39;ve seen some women who have a few extra pounds that I&#39;ve found attractive.
Just shows how children do not hold the love from their mother of the same value as from their father. The father always gets to be the cool parents who brings shit from McDonalds, meanwhile the mother does the actual job of parenting, household chores, disciplining, cooking, telling them to do the homework, while the overweight father gets to enjoy tv and leave the dishes on the table
Big girl here, wouldn’t wear anything more than a bikini for swimming, because fat girl swimsuits are made for beach wales.  They put far too much cloth to look modest, but all that material ain’t comfortable for swimming and definitely not staying indefinitely wet in. Women who wear something like that typically won’t take a splash of water.
The one thing about binge eating for me was that I felt like I had to rush my meals. I grew up being asked to hurry up and cram my mouth with heaps of rice so I could be allowed to leave the dining table. As an adult, I had developed this habit well until last year, when I learnt to slow down and take my time. Not only does it help me be aware of how full I am, it also reminds me to actually taste my food. Another thing that I learnt by doing that was how salty my meals actually were. I was stuffing myself with so much carbs and MSG (think rice, thick sauces and deep fried dishes). Now I try to eat cleaner and it has reduced that heavy bloated feeling and I feel that this small habit has made such a huge change in my eating/diet mindset.
I don&#39;t think I can tell someone how to lose weight since I&#39;ve never had these problems. But if I was to give an advice it would be to reduce the amount of unhealthy habits and intentionaly create good habits. Like for example last year I realised that after finishing university andstarting work I was getting in a worse shape over time. When that happened I didn&#39;t go to gym. Instead I started jogging like 1-2 km a day, did like 10 push ups and that was it. I also started intentionally avoiding any unhealthy food. Reasonably though. I try to eat mostly home made meals or something in fancy restaurants that it whole food, nothing artificially processed. Other than that. I eat aa much as I feel like and have greatly incresed the amount of exercises. Now I feel much better. It&#39;s going back to 16-18 year old body when I was sorta athletic (nothing special though, but could do about 25-30 pull ups for example). I think it is a good way to improve your health in a long run. Just avoid extreams.
5th highest grossing movie in Australian history so far. The Hans Zimmer score is 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The only woman who exercises and is still fat.
I know it&#39;s not really related, but for the first kid who wanted to play in the NFL, offensive and defensive linemen are usually very overweight and it&#39;s the &quot;peak shape&quot; for their position. You even see some of them after they retire they shed off so much weight cause they&#39;re no longer eating 4000+ calories a day
🎀Thé brush you used for your bronzer looks so soft and plush.🎀
This is the single biggest problem today is the little girls of 20 and 30 years ago that never had any discipline or guidance from their fathers are now adults and nothing but 304s.. no wifie material for the guys to marry, just 304s..
I am so fucking disgusting When I see the title like “Socialism vs Capitalism” . As an escapee escaped from CCP China which is in dictatorship. I really really wish those people who love socialism they must go CCP China to feel the iron fist of socialism
I used to love Disney. But just as Ben says.. they&#39;re ruining everything we grew up with and doing it blatantly in our faces. They have gone so woke.. it&#39;s disgusting.
god damnit i am crying ugly tears at tammy&#39;s &quot;i sure the hell did!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m worth it!&quot; she was so sad and hurt and didn&#39;t value her life before i feel like an old friend conquered a terminal illness fr omfg. YES TAMMY
they really think if you don&#39;t blindly agree with them on everything then that means you hate fat people. jfc make it make sense.
Obese people generally live off the government they don&#39;t contribute to society it&#39;s a drain on social security
fun fact , if you just dance around while playing music you can lose alot of weight. i dont do any real styles but just copy 1% of what belly dancer do and youll have alot of fun. also check out different indian schools of dance. if youre religious or non specific religious , i highly recommend it. alot of indian dance is actually prayers, thank yous, and blessings to gods. whenever i dance , i like to imagine myself at the foot of a behemoth throne , gold and surrounded by clouds, and my creator watches over me as i dance for them like a baby horse learning to walk. it brings me great joy. and i hope it bring you joy as well. my heart is pounding from happiness
I don’t understand why would you think that you’re not eating enough. Like, then where do you think all this weight came from??
have you seen virgin mountain? it doesnt focus on the fat issue a lot but i really liked the movie
Your videos are so helpful to me on my weight loss journey. They help me to stay focused on my goals❤
Those of y&#39;all who don&#39;t know, as of 2023 she has had weight loss surgery, lost over 300 lbs and gotten married!! SLAYY MISS TAMMY SLAAAY
Well my mum left me  for another man Because he didn’t want a child. And my father was an alcoholic. My grandma brought me up but not love, she was very annoyed most of the time. No wonder I<br>Always ended up with abusive men in a relationship. Maybe I’m screwed up for life then
I’m a recovering alcoholic, and because I drank my calories, I have a very complicated relationship with food. The idea of being addicted to eating, something you HAVE to do to stay alive, is really scary, because I know what it feels like to THINK you need your substance. Food addicts NEED to eat, like anyone else. If I had to take a couple shots every day, I would never stop drinking. I’m trying really hard to unlearn my judgement of overweight people: genetics and the science of fattening food has a lot to do with it, but I also remember how I felt when I drank thousands of calories of whiskey a week. The world is scary and sucks and it’s getting worse, and we all cope in different ways.
The best example that being obese isn&#39;t ok is the sheer amount of people who watch videos like this (and might be reading this) who previously bought into the BoPo slogans that keep you unhealthy and complacent, then said &quot;No more&quot; and &quot;Never again&quot;.<br><br>No amount of rallying the &quot;large and in charge&quot; can persuade people that missing out on your life and your family is worth it.

Given the disclosures in the past 18 months the sad part is that especially for teens the misery is the feature not the glitch. Apparently depression and clicking on eating disorder content happens with alarming rapidity on these platforms. It can be fatal for some. Filters add to the discrepancy-percieved between the &quot;ideals&quot; and the self. Leaving the ordinary user in the painful thrall of social com parison theory. G
oh gosh I love hourglass, but that concealer is sooo  thick and &#39;makeup-y&#39;.  not a fan.
I am on the 8th day of my water fast and I went from overweight* to a normal bmi- lost 16 lbs.<br><br> I&#39;ve gotten 4x as many smiles, way more stares, &quot;have a good days&quot; from strangers... makes me feel like maybe I am also biased towards overweight people.
Positivity?  Complete crap.  You are fat. You are obeise.  This is NOT a good thing.  Deal with reality.<br>I am paralyzed.  Regulating intake is a major thing if I want to remain alive.  F-you and everything that you stand for.<br>When a body positivity influencer dies?  Hundreds are helped.
As a Russian citizen, who lived most of my life in Moscow and actively opposed Putin, I can say that Putin&#39;s actions aren&#39;t as calculated and strategic as it may seem.<br><br>He is a senile dictator. Not much different from African warlords, really. The big difference is that he has a much more organized corruption group who runs the whole country and steals from the nation on scale that&#39;s really difficult to immagine. He controlls the media in Russia and covers his people who steal from any government controlled industry in the country. <br><br>His invasion of Ukraine is a gross miscalculation: <br>- He underestimated the people of Ukraine. His intel told him that Ukranians would welcome Russian army and will actually greet them with flowers. Instead,  his troops encountered people who would die rather than surrender their lands and homes.<br>- He overestimated his troops. Decades of corruption and stealing left his army poorly equiped, badly trained, and ill-motivated. <br>- His plan relied on taking Kiev in three days (that was officially said by a lot of Russian media when the war started), and changing the government there. Now that he failed, he improvises, but his reign left him a country that&#39;s easy to rule, but hard to make efficient. Production, international affairs, mobilisation and even propaganda - all of that is crumbling.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t mean that he isn&#39;t dangerous or that people of Russia have any realistic chance of dethroning him any time soon, but that means that he is heading towards his inevitable defeat. <br>We can only hope that this madman won&#39;t resort to nuclear weapons to go down with a bang.
The US of A is going rapidly into decline, and nowhere is this more obvious than in their so-called culture wars. Its citizens are encouraged to become unhealthily mega-fat through its addiction to mega-consumption, then the poor slobs are shamed for being unhealthily mega-fat, then the same slobs are told, no, it is beautiful to be unhealthily mega-fat... because the fashion labels say so and they want Walmart to share a bit of the XXL clothing market. Just keep those muffin and McFlurry supply lines going 🤣🤣
30 years ago,, people didnt get fat from eating food... now  look at the american population....whats changed?....  food quality... amounts... sitting around
the weight you lose would be the money in your pocket
Who is the British person responsible for arbitrating the weight of “a stone”?
I dont want to sound like im thinking that im a &quot;healthy example&quot;, because im not (bmi 16, not anorexic or anything). But i never understood &quot;binge eating&quot;, like why? Also i love making my own food, if there is a way for me to make it from scratch, i will do it (for example my own pasta, or my own burger buns or just anything, i like knowing what i eat (maybe im just autistic, because i also like knowing what medicine i take, i really dont like taking some pills without knowing what is the main substance in them and how it affects my body)). The think that i believe is the most unhealth thing in my diet is that i dont have schedule for eating, i just eat when i feel hungry, sometimes (most often when im spending whole day in front of a pc (programmer)) i can get by on single sandwich per day, other times i can eat 4 course meal and still feel hungry. My favorite meals are toasts, avocado toast, toasts with &quot;skagenröra&quot; (Swedish prawn salad), or just toast with some type of cold meat and tomato with mozzarella and a bit of olive oil. Like i said i dont want say that im a &quot;healthy example&quot;, because im not, but i believe that im more healthy than most americans (sorry, dont feel ofended, i know you probably will), but i dont think that BMI is very good measurement for &quot;healty&quot;, just like i dont believe that iq is good measurement for &quot;intelligence&quot;, but whole my life i was on the skinny side. (Guy, 185cm and around 55-60kg, i never in my life were above 65kg, never had health problems caused by my diet. I dont go ty gym, but i have active lifestyle, 15,000 steps per day is little for me, love biking). @KianaDocherty what is your opinion about my lifestyle?<br><br>edit: Today im 20 years old, 185cm and 62kg. BMI of 18.1 (0% underweight)
I discovered this mechanism myself in pandemic. Sent to home office, I liked it first. Then, after a few weeks I thought I am gonna die from back pain. Being a person who used to cycle to work every single day and generally move a lot, I had terrible back pains and felt exhausted like an old lady (being 34 at that time). I called my GP and they prescribed me some pain killers but I realized that if something doesn&#39;t change, I would end up as a hospital patient 😢<br><br>Being imprisoned at home, I bought myself accessories for gym, an ergonomic chair and started to re-invent gym at home. It went so well I even had to take a break because I stretched my back too much 😂 <br><br>From now on, I observe this phenomena very closely on myself. I move = All is good. I stop moving for a longer time, my backbone, joints and feet start to get painful. So I keep regular exercise habits not only to be fit and skinny but to stay healthy. It&#39;s not a whim, it&#39;s staying alive 😊<br>I feel better than most of my younger friends who complain non stop about their pains and how movement hurts.
Im a nurse, 90% of my patients this size are completely immobile. Trapped in bed, unable to even turn back and forth in bed when someone changes their diaper. We use essentially metal cranes in order to lift them. So for people to say this is a derogatory depiction, most people of this size could not even open the door to grab that pizza. Like get a grip on yourself before publicly reviewing something with such a skewed outlook
Maybe we have a different recipe in my country, but Diet Coke is just disgusting and it’s not popular at all
I don&#39;t count my calories or my carbs. I eat when I want, and I eat primarily healthy. Who cares about calories, it&#39;s not  sustainable to keep that up. Keto what? I just eat %2 processed food and the rest is fresh. I am 5&#39;3 and between a size 2 and a size 4 any given day. I am also 31 and have birthed one child. People need to eat more healthier to stay healthier and happier. Stop eating crap and you will feel good.
Well I am lazy and old ugly and fat. Relatives healthy exercise  clean eaters and most not past 50 before they kill over. 53 still breathing for now
My experience with body immage issues began in the 7th grade when we had nutrition lessons in biology and i started being less of a picky eater. This resulted in me getting a bit more chubby. It wasn&#39;t bad it was just going from scrawny and short to a bit more chubby with a bit of a belly and still short. Due to being bullied already cause I was quick to anger they just found a new avenue for ridicule. This lessened with time especially after some of them left the school or got chill but it popped up from now and then with comments about me bulking(some of them were weigh into fittnes and gym.) Fortunatly due to a combination of me being too lazy to go to the gym, me being fixated on school and gaming, getting therapy for my Anger issues(turns out I have aspergers) and my belly not being the primary source of ridicule I avoided my body image issues developing into some sort of eating disorder. <br>I know I am not the worst off. I just wanted to share my story and play the world smallest violin. (Great song from ajr. )
The bite-sized fork experimentally welcome because grass phenotypically surround pro a dreary sword.  foamy, muddled bulb
As someone who was very overweight in middle school, I got my life together in 9th grade, stopped failing, stopped stammering and then ended up heading debate in school, and ended up earning admission to an Ivy League college. All because I was able to make that one choice - to get healthy. This gave me enough confidence to see myself as something more than weight. I was able to be my best self. This hit home. Thank you.
I like the protein % given. I think  informing people of good nutrition fats ( that would total about 70%) they will not have any insulin response and give you a total satiated feeling with the most energy.  cholesterol is no longer a problem by FDA. check out a Carnivore diet for healthy eating and super fast weight loss. Low carb high fat. no factory processed  oils.
Where is fat influencer now?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV55Ocz-jII&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> what&#39;s up with this form of taking insulin? It&#39;s not the first time that i see people take up the bottle and use a syringe..... but it is STRANGE!!!<br>like.. don&#39;t they have pre-filled pens? Is that only a Europe thing? Just saying because it looks like a very very cumbersome way to administer insulin.<br>@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV55Ocz-jII&amp;t=3m50s">3:50</a> .... Why?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xC-vs407c&amp;t=7m35s">7:35</a>  😂😂 in grad school (im a scientist) a biochemist professor hated the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because cholesterol had no behavior/mind/etc to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; I can just envision her reading a final where I discuss fat cells feeling comfortable enough to release themselves. &quot;im finally happy enough to do this&quot; like its a game of the Sims<br><br>(all scientists have soapboxes they will die on and this was hers, its not a universal pet peeve. like i dont care about this but i will absolutely go off on a tirade if someone says one of my soapbox points)
It’s great that you have had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9kKUTWZSg8&amp;t=3m03s">3:03</a>  so much success. As much you motivate and encourage others to succeed on their journeys to health, that is a great thing. <br>I believe that obesity is unhealthy. The research does show that there is a strong genetic component to obesity. There are also significant socioeconomic indicators of health that underlie obesity. My knowledge of obesity is that it is a result of a complex combination of factors. It’s not just a matter of personal willpower or inner strength. <br>In fact, my view of many obese people is that they have tried multiple times to lose weight, and that it takes tremendous courage to keep trying, even if failure seems likely. I respect them for that, and would never demean anyone for failure. <br>Yes, obesity can be overcome, it’s not impossible, but this will never occur as a result of<br>any kind of denigration.<br>Again, since your videos inspire others in a positive manner, I applaud you.
Parents are to blame they don&#39;t educate themselves or learn how to cook, obestiality is everywhere,, Mac Donald&#39;s being the worst out let for junk food,  children are not born fat, it&#39;s the parents fault for being uneducated and lazy fact
Bu yedikleri yiyecekler bu kadar sorun yaritiyorsa bence bu zararli yiyecekleri bir daha yürtmese insanlarda bu kadar zarar görmez.
My 20-year-old niece keeps gaining weight and doesn’t care. Her mother can’t mention the weight gain or she yells back - don’t body shame me. Dangerous, selfish message.
That’s a VP?  No!  That is disgusting &amp; unprofessional.  An embarrassment to my country.
Now, it is utterly BOLLOCKS to claim that obesity is caused by poverty that in turn leads to a lack of money to buy nutritious food.<br><br>If you are poor, you will not even have access to junk food.<br><br>In the more intelligent East where I come from, obesity is known as a rich person&#39;s plight. We have a euphemism here to describe an overweight person. We would often say in jest, &#39;Wow. Long time no see. You look prosperous now.&#39;<br><br>Most baby boomers and their parents, the interwar generation, were never overweight. Many were skinny or even ripped, to use today&#39;s adjective.<br><br>My paternal grandparents were a tad better off than my maternal grandparents. And you can tell by their physicality. My paternal grandfather went to the elite schools. He became a watercolour artist and a pioneer in my country for drawing the nude female form. Even his vocation was bourgeois. He was not fat but on the plump side.<br><br>My mother&#39;s father had formal schooling up to only nine or ten years old. He was a street food hawker. And he was scrawny.<br><br>Hmm. The bourgeois grandfather lived to 73. The scrawny grandfather? 96. And he started to have dementia only after 90.
It&#39;s the toxins in the food plus the unnecessary additives
You explained the concept of intuitive eating quite precisely ;). And although you might speak quite critically about HAES in one of your videos, you just pointed out some of the main principles around HAES food advice :). Eat when you&#39;re hungry. Stop when you&#39;re full. Include feel-good movement. Eat fibre. Enjoy your meal with all senses.  What a certain Instagram culture made of this inclusive movement and its good intention ... well, I share your criticism at some point. By the way these principles equal the principles of Intuitive Eating (such facts combined with audios for subconscious changes). 1. Eat when you&#39;re hungry. 2. Eat what makes you feel happy and healthy. 3. Enjoy your meal and trust your hunger signals. 4. Stop when you feel adequalely satiated. Started both HAES theory and Intuitive Eating practice to get back in line with my body and to make peace with it. Most ironically, lost weight with it. Now I&#39;m combining both aspects and write about HAES and body-related topics in my blog,, among other topics  :). Another fun fact at this point ... In earlier times, social pressure and negative feelings led to emotional eating (my Intuitive Eating programme steps into the subconscious part of emotional eating) and since I have been practising this idea (theoretically it was known to me through HAES), the same negative emotions result in  total lack of appetite so I must force myself to eat then. Sorry long post - but might be helpful for you :).
I&#39;m a young guy who never watched the original top gun, but I went and watched it right before this film, seeing the two back to back was great, sure I personally liked maverick better, but that was not at the cost of the previous film. Maverick was brilliant and engaging the whole time, and the fighter jet scenes as re some of the most exhilarating action in recent years. It feels like there&#39;s so much on the line and one misstep one possible iota of miscalculation and the mission fails. They do a real good job of making the audience feel the weight of this mission, which ultimately pays off so well. And of course no woke garbage, just good film making.
What I do is use a mini spatula to break down the broken makeup even more into super small pieces, and then I use the flat end of a super fat brush or brush cover to tamp down the small pieces, to make a whole pan. This technique also applies when my pressed powder is almost gone, but I want to save the small slivers that break away from the corners of the pan. I just have a small tub specially for the purpose, and save the slivers onto it.
A) Do not buy, then it is not there to eat.<br>B) Remember the following are borring food that are getting you fat, do avoid 100%: rice, pasta, bread and potatoes.
I dint know what&#39;s more: &quot;depressing or plain stupidity&quot;. Peorple like this woman, push for an ideal, which is actually more self defeating to their race/culture. Muslims in the U.S.A. is a perfect example. Muslims in this country are here, because it&#39;s a better life. The kind of life, the world of Islam which would deny them all the freedoms and prosperities they take for granted here! As for gays, feminists and far lefts? Don&#39;t even get me started.
these products  leave you looking fresh and youthful, plumped skin texture, dewy finish. Yes i do think its an &#39;lunch after swimming/sunbathing, look.&#39; ...Or a &#39;cool, fresh , pink  &#39;walking through Green Park [london] &#39; feel/look. ...her sheer blush, becomes a bit more understandable, innocent, cool, natural, healthy. , no makeup look...
MFs really out here measuring weight in fucking stones
Hello my name is Quinton Merritt , I&#39;m a complete idiot and a perfect example of the downfall of America. Everybody around me has confirmed my ignorance plus I wear a wifebeater and i have a predator haircut!
Trump&#39;s reduction of taxes for the wealthy, who were already profiting from tax breaks and hoarding their fortunes, has already negatively affected our economy and infrastructure. We must not only roll back those cuts, but tax the rich and reduce taxes of the poor!  Equity for all.  Capitalism has led to this unfair tax system which has fueled autocracy and greed, and the normalizing of unaccountability.
Why is there so much obsession and discussion about fat people ?  <br><br>Why do others care so much about other people’s  weight ?  I seriously don’t get it .  <br><br>Can someone explain please .
I wish my parents knew how bad and unhealthy fast food was before they ended up obese
Stop complaining ! It’s like jail and expensive ? Good let that be a lesson to them and especially they’re parents to maybe look at the food they are eating . It’s not like they were forced to get obese .
Has anyone problems with setting spray making their hair gross ?
size might not matter but do you know what does ? the age of consent ❤
“Okay well first of all if we are going to talk about triggers, social media in and of itself is a GIANT trigger” <br><br>YES, agreed Demi! 🙌🏻
On the topic of food ordering apps- I’m on the other end of the spectrum, anorexia binge/purge subtype. I developed a huge shame in people seeing me in relation to food, and I hated purging in public restrooms. I dont have a car, either, so picking up food from my favorite binge spots in near impossible where I live. So, I turned to food delivery apps. They made me spiral to crazy levels. I was binging and purging multiple times everyday, I was spending absurd amounts of money on food and delivery. And because of this, I was investing even less food than normal, as my time was taken up binging and purging, so I lost even more weight. It was a dark time in my life. I swore off food delivery. If I want to binge and purge, I have to go get it. And that has dramatically decreased the frequency. My general consensus- food delivery apps are bad for EVERYONE. It should not be so easy to get food.
That&#39;s what my father did. Now I&#39;m engaged to a man who is terrified by the idea of having a girl. I sincerely believe by the time our children are old enough to have these social issues, the world will be past some of this, thanks to good people who got involved, like Brett.
the only problem with your stupid bs argument Ben is that your basis for it is based in some made up bullshit about a floaty dude in the sky that lives in a castle of gold and if you worship him enough you will go there when you die. You supporting the ABOLISHMENT of ALL FORMS OF ABORTION means that women who are going to have a fatal delivery, or a child that will be born into pain and disability and never have a life worth living, all those options to abort DANGEROUS pregnancies will go with it. you are a fkn idiot to say that there is no legitimacy in ANY abortion.
Wait isnt brittain kind of obese too?
wasn&#39;t there a video of a woman who danced inappropriately at her fathers funeral or something as well?
When you are lifting weights concentrate on pushing your bellybutton to your spine. Concentrate on your core. This will help with your neck issue.
This is actually a true face of depression. It&#39;s not being sad with some sad music in your head as they portrait it in movies. Nope. It&#39;s anger, it&#39;s personality degrading, it&#39;s tantrums, it&#39;s derealisation, it&#39;s loosing any connection with people around you. People do not like that part of depression. It&#39;s ugly and horrifying illness which will make your whole personality rott.
Claiming that it is physically impossible to lose weight when millions of people regularly do it every single day is nothing short of complete and utter delusion.
It doesn’t seem like you really understand the psychology of being an overweight person or what body positivity is (though as well as some obese people you show in your videos). Your channel looks like you are just one of those fat shaming people who don’t understand that talking about health consequences is not helping at all. What helps these people is not just things like  “stop eating”, “move more” or “pull yourself together and just do it” but love and supporting environment , activities they actually like doing, a good therapist, respectful attitude, supporting family etc. Because food addiction always has something to do  with guilt, stress coping, eating up emotions because of inability to deal with them, childhood traumas and low self esteem and other “benefits” from being overweight for our brain. If I were you I’d rather stop just shaming fat people or do superiority talk on how you were overweight and point out the other real side of the problem. Why people get obese and why fat activist became what it is today.
I hate to say this, but for the longest time I honestly thought Tammy just didn’t have it in her to lose the weight.  I was so happy when she proved me wrong ❤
did you ever watch Super Size VS Super Skinny? that was a great uk diet show, just about every person was a success. a really great format
Causing people to lose weight by weaponizing their laziness? That&#39;s genius!
I’ve been a bit too skinny my whole life and I have to credit my parents for having me grow up very healthy, I couldn’t imagine my life without being Athletic. Although tbf I acually need to gain weight and idk how people do it I get full after a reg portion meal and fast food just tastes so bad I’d rather skip a meal than eat at mcd or Wendy’s
It helped me to move out and not live with my mom anymore. I stopped binge eating and cook my own. But I couldn&#39;t lose weight so I had surgery 2 weeks ago and I have no problems sticking with the dïet that comes with it.
With a 60 plus percent chance of divorce with an 80 percent chance she files ya miss me with all that.   This isn’t 1950.  The world has changed and marriage is irrelevant.
Tammy will never change period! Even if she is in care and loses a lot of weight gets the surgery she will just gain it all back and more. She is drawn to men who like huge women and boom she will do anything for them what&#39;s sad is she won&#39;t do that for herself .
Why would you give this gross racist a platform.
Not only is being fat unattractive, it’s bad for your health. Who knew.
I found your videos though Megan Anne about a week or two ago, and I&#39;ve been straight BINGEING your content ever since 😭<br>So I have a few things to say:<br>1. I LOVE your hair 2 years ago with the highlights 🤩😍 okrrrrrt<br>2. Your channel has finally, COMPLETELY removed the victim mentality from my life. (I can&#39;t lie, Andrew Tate actually gave me the initial push I needed, you&#39;ve given me the final shove I clearly needed.)<br>3. Since watching your videos, I&#39;ve begun writing down goals, shifting my thought processes, and analyzing myself quite differently than before. It&#39;s noticeable!!<br>4. I&#39;ve never been too &quot;overweight&quot; (I&#39;m 5&#39; 4&quot;, never been more than 150 and that was back in 5th grade; I&#39;m 31 now and 134 lbs) but your content on food makes me realize that I most likely have an unhealthy relationship with food anyway, that weight doesn&#39;t always mark health when it&#39;s thin we&#39;re looking at. <br><br>I apologize for the length of this comment but I&#39;m like 20 videos deep and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said any of this<br><br>And finally, 5. You are my new most favorite, go-to YouTuber!<br><br>Oh, and 6 is a question: I needed braces my entire life, but my mum and I didn&#39;t realize we could afford them until I was in high school, when I was too embarrassed to get them. I said, &quot;I&#39;ll just get adult braces🫣&quot; but here I am, in my 30s, afraid of the pain, the drooling, the headgear, the awkward sex stuff...can you tell me if it&#39;s terrible as all that? Or am I just freaking myself out? 🥺 They fit you so well so I&#39;m wondering if maybe there&#39;s a chance they&#39;re not that bad ?<br><br>Thanks for all your effort and labor! You&#39;re teaching so many people so much 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍♥️🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
This man’s inner pain is so plainly on display, his poor self-image translated into a horrible obsession for his brand. In his mind he must’ve carried an ugly self-image that he just couldn’t shake, so instead he leaned into the whole premise of his brand. Leaned in hard, and of course the end result was gross, disturbing even.
