Jeffree Your vest is ugly What are you doing
Not even joking, Jeffree Star saved my life. And I&#39;m not talking about, ok, he influenced me and follow him and blah blah blah, I&#39;m not a super fan or anything... no offense to Jeffree! I just hate TickTok, Instagram, basically any social media forms! Lol call me old fashioned. But anyways... No one should ever be mean to Jeffree! That&#39;s one bad ass person, now I haven&#39;t seen anything he&#39;s done recently and haven&#39;t been following anything he&#39;s been doing, sorry bud, but I was friends with him back in the days of MYSPACE! before anyone really knew knew who he really was, before he got so popular. I mean he was popular, of course, but not to the level he is now. And he would actually talk to me messages here and there when we just needed to get shit out. He hated to share anything... Hated to let people in, but when he does, he&#39;s the most amazing fucking person. <br>I was in a huge fight with my boyfriend one night... I had no one, I was home all alone. I logged onto MySpace, and no one was there for me when I needed to talk. They were all about their problems and their own selfishness. I sat there for for over an hour trying so hard to find someone to talk to. Finally Jeffree signed on and just wrote a message that said HEY GIRL! I broke down and said shits so hard. He said, GIRL TALK! Not even 5 mons earlier, I was about to sign off and no joke, was going to kill myself, nothing in my life was going right, my Godfather had died, my best friend passed away the week earlier too, then my boyfriend was about to leave me, and if it weren&#39;t for me just staying on for 5 more mins on that damn computer and talking to the most amazing JEFFREE in the world, I would NOT be here today. He saved my life. For an entire hour of trying to find out if all my friends to talk to and none of them wanted to talk to Me, my CLOSE SO CALLED FRIENDS! They only wanted to talk about themselves, yet Jeffree was there, and he had never let me before in person, we just messaged back and forth on Myspace, He had days where he would vent to me and I&#39;d vent to him, that&#39;s what we did. I&#39;m so upset I lost touch with him, because I never got to truly TRULY thank him for saving my life. I have a beautiful 9yr old daughter now, and even though I&#39;ve been battling bone cancer and can&#39;t work, I have nothing, and it&#39;s so so hard some days to even get through the day.  When you can&#39;t work, you have no money, and with no money, you can&#39;t live, I&#39;ve lost 50 lbs in a week because I have to make sure my daughter eats which means that I just am not able to eat sometimes, but after all that... All I have to do is look back and just remember that conversation I had with Jeffree. I&#39;m telling you. It brings me right back to the mentality of I KNOW IVE FUCKING GOT THIS! And I can&#39;t even begin to explain to you people, there is not enough words in the English language, or any language, to describe how thankful I am for JEFFREE STAR and what he has done for me. I know he will never read this but I wish so so badly that someone could get him a message from me just telling him THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MOST AMAZING YOU, AND DONT EVER CHANGE! Thank you Jeffree Star for saving my life. I know I could never repay you, because you can&#39;t possibly give anything to a person to someone whom has everything, especially when I have nothing to even give, but if I could, I would. I&#39;d give him my heart, my love and anything I could possibly give him to give him the world! <br>You&#39;re the best Jeffree and I hope one day this message finds you so you can know I truly appreciate you. Thank you!
I don&#39;t understand how someone can take such ugly such unpigmented colors and still make it look gorgeous Jeffree can literally make ANYTHING look good

Yeah, WY has 1 day of summer. It snows in July, August, ect. Good thing you get to leave whenever you want cuz that state sucks. I&#39;m assuming the no state tax is part of what attracted you tho. Could you help out the wild horses because ranchers there are the reason they&#39;re being corraled and sold off for meat cuz they don&#39;t want them grazing on their many hundreds of acres. It&#39;s disgusting

Yeah, WY has 1 day of summer. It snows in July, August, ect. Good thing you get to leave whenever you want cuz that state sucks. I&#39;m assuming the no state tax is part of what attracted you tho. Could you help out the wild horses because ranchers there are the reason they&#39;re being corraled and sold off for meat cuz they don&#39;t want them grazing on their many hundreds of acres. It&#39;s disgusting
Noooo.. I look fat 😂😂
