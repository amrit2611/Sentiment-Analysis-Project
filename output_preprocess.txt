just saw documentary it was fascinating to see part of my childhood deconstructed like that still i am not sure i agree with general idea that backlash against brand and effects are good first of all there was not really any karmic punishment here there was no comeuppance man was making 40 million year for while and then quit working with 27 million dollar retirement payout he won he is winner second while i definitely agree that certain aspects of company needed to come under scrutiny and needed to be eliminated treatment of models or sexualization of teenagers for instance i do not think trying to force brand to cater to everyone at risk of being destroyed by public outcry was good strategy abercrombie was built on one idea of what ideal allamerican looklifestyle is people who disagreed with that idea who found themselves excluded from it for their skin color religion or body shape have come together to build new brand that took same idea and expressed it in way that was inclusive without trying to force notion that traditional very conservative very preppy very white idea of americana needs to die why question_symbol why cannot people who still feel that way have businesses that cater to them question_symbol why is not there room for more than one idea of american identity question_symbol if you do not feel like business fits you take your money elsewhere why do you have to actively try to destroy it so you can feel validated at all times in all places by all people question_symbol like i know chickfila does not like me i know it does not want my business i am not going to picket to try to force them to do it i am just going to buy my chicken elsewhere will i let other people know about things i disagree with about chickfila question_symbol sure but if they choose to still go there i am not going to cry about it and start protest

tati exclamation_symbol i love this video exclamation_symbol you do you exclamation_symbol i am hoping you will share how you lost weight as someone who is heavier than i have ever been i love to know your tips on weight loss pleasepink_heart love you and all of your videos
sixty years ago when i was kid we had sugary cereals candy cookies etc yet in my household we had nutritious meals and healthy snacks such as fruit raw vegetables and dried fruit my parents never brought that stuff into house carbonated beverages were rare treat purchased at woolworth lunch counter after buying school supplies also unlike school kids today who are mostly bussed to school we walked or rode bikes to school at school we had two recesses and gym class few times week i protested when recesses and gym class were eliminated as cost saving measures as children need to move my class growing up had very few chubby kids now obesity and even diabetes are plaguing our kids guaranteeing shorter and sicker lives for our children its time to take control again and saying no to junk food and yes to physically active lives
i am glad i watched this video as someone who is struggled with being chubby kid all my life when i looked through your channel i got extremely bad vibes because i am someone activeley working on myself eating better exercising everything but when i saw your videos all i saw were clickbait titles and i got very uncomfortable i was not even aware of this fat positive movement i was only ever aware of bigger body positive movement which i am very much in support of and i am glad you clarified obese because lot of people think overweight and obese are same thing and they very much are not
i know this is 3 years late but if she made it in baby pink it will be fly silver is ugly
this video has really driven home just how selfish and manipulative selfcreated victims truly are tammy is basically my exmother she was so vile that i disowned her decades ago but while i lived with her i saw many of traits tammy displays with my exmother i called it her martyr role she was constantly complaining whining and inviting people to join her pity party she literally lived victim mentalityyet whenever anyone offered to help she say in very martyred voice oh no do not you worry about me i will do it myself and then in next breath complain again about how no one ever helps her it was manipulative to disgusting degree interspersed with her hatefilled rants against people her racism was also offensiveafter i disowned her she and exfather had done things that should have landed them in jail whenever people asked about my family i say that i no longer had contact and sometimes i explained why there were people who judged me for disowning those toxic people i responded by kicking them out of my life i was not going to tolerate anyone who expected me to go back to abusive people simply because but they are faaamily my siblings still kept in touch with their parents and not only tolerated but enabled their toxic behaviours and that cost one married brother his marriage his wife and kids got fed up with way he allowed his parents to treat them i knew from that alone that i had made right choice in kicking out two vile people out of my lifewatching these videos about infamous tammy has reminded me of extreme guilt tripping pathological lies gas lighting rewriting reality and shameless manipulation i endured from my exmother she was innately dishonest with herself and with others plays victim card like champion and still uses my spineless brother as her lackey because she refuses to change her ways and he is fullfledged enabler and doormati am grateful that i found right sort of counsellor decades ago who helped me recognise just how toxic these family members were and are and these days i do not feel shred of guilt or shame about having kicked those people out of my life it is about caring enough about my wellbeing to remove everyone and everything toxic out of my life so they can no longer damage me i now enjoy freedom and peace
i am sorry but on some level i have to believe that these people are actually stupid like access to information nowadays is ridiculous you know what you are doing you are just lying to yourself and you are dumb for getting on tv show and doing that i just do not understand that how can you on one hand say i do not eat sweets or anything like that i do not have sugar but then on other hand slamming large cokes chocolate bars and everything else with your fast food meals
nobody hates fat people more than their own pancreas and livers and kidneys etc

i hate to say this because freedom of speech and freedom of press were once critical in truth being known and to hold people accountable but we are heading towards our very freedoms being tools of evildoers to expedite our once great country is downfallour tolerance invites radicals who utilize our freedoms to work against us countries like china russia and iran use our freedoms against us via internet at some point we need strong leaders need to formulate plan to identify evil and put measures in place to disallow these groups from using our freedoms against us for good of our nation left and right will need to put in place safeguards not to allow one political party to silence other if we do not do something like this it is only matter of time before we collapse just as someone cannot shout fire in crowded theater we need to ban and enforce bans against actions harming our country

best example that being obese is not ok is sheer amount of people who watch videos like this and be reading this who previously bought into bopo slogans that keep you unhealthy and complacent then said no more and never againno amount of rallying large and in charge can persuade people that missing out on your life and your family is worth it

it is not companies fault exclamation_symbol it is kids and parents fault companies can not force you to eat their product you as parent choose what your kid can and can not eat banning cartoons off fast food and junk food is bs that is marketing… nothing wrong with that but it is you parents who makes decision if you will buy said product for your kid but when parents gives said option to kid it is now up to child to make best decision now said child will most likely choose as their parents thus meaning if parents set good examples child most likely pick out healthier options… and then splurge every now and then you be asking how do i know question_symbol cause this is how i am being raised i am 16 and half now in high school and i make plenty of my own decisions almost all of which were influenced by my parents i know i have insane metabolism but i admit i do eat junk food it is just i am constantly burning those extra calories on average day i need as much as 2500 calories on weeks when i am up at fire college with my explorer post doing training for up to 10 hours i easily eat 30003500 calories and plenty of water and electrolytes i know my body type how active i am and how fast process proteins carbohydratessugars fats and other nutrients that is being said my parents guided me throughout life to make good solid choice when it comes to meal this is why i stand by claim parents and children are problem… not companies change my mind…

it is okay to be fat it is not okay to be unhealthy
i was able to lose 60 lbs since august and i feel so much better i ate so horribly and so much i fed myself on fast food sugary drinks and candy so much candy i got up to 250lbsmy doctor put me on ketogenic diet with lots of cruciferous vegetables and salads while i also did intermittent fasting and i was able to lose all of that weight i was able to get off of heartburn medicine that i was on and i just feel overall so much healthier plus being able to fit into thinner clothes was added benefit as welli did get quite alot of help by using factor meal delivery service to order correct kind of food but it is way healthier than fast food and is about same if maybe cheaper than what i was spending on fast foodmy relationship with sugar and food in general has changed so much i am no longer being dictated by food and i have so much more time than waiting in lines for fast foodi like to transition to cooking from scratch all of food that i want to eat but my current work and living situation makes that difficult but in future i am going to work on that as welli also need to build more muscle and lose more fat

i also changed up my diet and eating habits in february this year i had been gaining and getting to fattest point in my life relatively fat my bmi was just on lower end of overweight i started intermittent fasting and doing strength resistance exercises 15 min day before breakfast lost 20lbs so far and it is steady now my clothes are getting looser still even though number on scale has not really changed smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes my pants size has gone from not fitting into 32 to easily fitting into 28 it is all about routine and perseverance no miracle cure for most people without certain medical problems like thyroid or whatever
it just blows my mind how socalled professional individuals were actually okay with threatened violence
i just can not imagine living life in this condition i have certainly had my own issues with weight but never obesity as i have gotten older i have learned and accepted fact that i have to eat certain way and exercise certain amount to keep myself at healthy weight while i enjoy benefits of liking what i see in mirror reason i do it is to enjoy latter years of my life and have nice retirement it amazes me that these folks are still alive but i find these shows to be extremely exploitive amazing how low we have come to society to objectify these people who are obviously struggling with not only physical health but mental health issues

hm i do not agree with many points here because controlled binge eating is having control most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when blood sugar drops so much that it is bodys mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things but thing you said with school is whole different topic for diet it is bad but for keeping your weight it is goodi did this most of my school time while having hashimoto which means my metabolismn is so bad that i get weight fast and lose weight hard but i had my rule first of all i never in my life eating breakfast if i have to wake up early i had rule that if i have 6 hours school i eat and drink nothing during that time if i have longer like 8 or 9 hours i will eat one apple and this i continued like 7 years question_symbol and it was fine in evening i ate tons of trash huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly because it was like remaining in control during day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy and in evening you reward yourself for it and i never gained any kg of weight during all years of course i did not lose neither but also not gained weight so i disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar

ok i am in no way fan of all of disneys new crap but i throughly enjoyed elemental it was finally original story and there were not any real agendas shoved in your face only thing i can recall like that was off handed comment about wades sister and her girlfriend sister barely had any part in movie other than that scene and that was it it was wonderful movie about wanting to hold on to family tradition while also wanting to find your own way in world ember main character had extremely close relationship with her father and that was main turmoil she was feeling because she wanted him to be proud of her as girl who adores her father has great relationship with him and wants to make him proud i greatly relate to that and romance aspect between ember and wade felt like completely traditional romeo and juliet plot stereotypes and assumptions about people who are different keep two lovers apart only for their love to bring everyone together and improve lives of those around them it was incredibly wholesome movie moved me to tears multiple times and even my extremely masculine cop boyfriend thought it was great i think elemental deserves shot because i was actually impressed by disney with that movie

eh not fan of diet coke back in day my only option was tab which to this day i miss although never to extent of liters day i actually prefer pepsi zero because it is sweeter some of coke zero flavors are palatable and others are downright disgusting ergo y3k if anything primary reason for addiction is caffeine of course i will drink diet or zero sugar coke if nothing else is available has to be zero sugar due to t1d although i am just as likely to drink unsweetened iced tea which again is caffeine usually soda in cans is not as good as soda in bottles for myself and it matters where you get it amount of syrup being used and expiration which yes there is one if anything i consider myself addicted to carbonation as i can just as easily drink club soda biggest reason i prefer pepsi zero or diet is because it is seemingly more consistent with flavor some coke zero or diet was randomly just disgusting whether purchased at store or restaurant just personal experience though

i am greek orthodox christian firstly i will try to explain why orthodoxy is only truecorrect faith secondly i will suggest some things that help anyone who is interested in orthodoxyfor first part orthodoxy is first original historically and only true faith which is outcome of direct revelation by god himself ιncarnated word of god jesus christ bible and thus is not relegion religiona manmade belief system which is trying to explain god as all known religions islamhinduism or christian heresies protestantism catholicism are hence orthodoxy is not gesture of men reaching god but is gesture of god revealing himself to men also is called orthodoxy which in greek language in which bible was written by apostles originally means correctorthoορθόςcorrect beliefdoxyδοξασίαδόξαbelieffaithdogmatenet and is faith of all greeks to which jesusgod saidjohn 122024 ²⁰some greeks had gone to jerusalem to worship during passover ²¹philip from bethsaida in galilee was there too so they went to him and said sir we like to meet jesus ²²philip told andrew then two of them went to jesus and told him²³jesus said time has come for son of man to be given his glory²⁴i tell you for certain that grain of wheat that falls on ground will never be more than one grain unless it dies but if it dies it will produce lots of wheat prophesying that time has come for him son of man jesus as 100 percentage_symbol human as son of virgin marytheotokos to die on cross grain of wheatit dies and then given his glory jesus as 100 percentage_symbol god after his resurrection and ascension to right hand of god also prophesying that his death will produce lots of wheat which is linked to greeks stating that greeks and also all other people which are not jewish and follow same path as greeks in that time symbolized all non jews will glorify jesus by recognizing him as their messiah savior and true god and they will keep true and correct faith orthodoxy and they will not go astray as heretics or other religions and in this way they will participate in production of lots of wheat in contrast to jews and other heretics catholics etc which will do go astray and so they will not be able to inherit gods kingdom and be gods by grace jesus was always before and after his death and always simultaneously 100 percentage_symbol human and 100 percentage_symbol god at first as 100 percentage_symbol god he took human nature by his gestation in virgin mary by holy spirit and became simultaneously 100 percentage_symbol human too then by his tortures and death of his human nature on cross he took upon himslef sin of entire fallen human nature and put end to it with death of this fallen nature of humans which did not had ability of theosis theosisto become god not by nature but by grace but was outcome of spiritual death and sin see genesis in old testament and fall of adam and eve finally with his resurrection and ascension as 100 percentage_symbol human and 100 percentage_symbol god simultaneously to right hand of god father and also with holy spirit to which he was fully connected to both of them always as second person of holy trinity by his 100 percentage_symbol god nature he led human nature to ability of theosis and inheritance of gods kingdom making humans who manage to go to heaven same as him by grace not by their naturegods by grace but there is big misconception in some heresies god did not ιncarnated became human and died on cross to put everyone who says that believes in jesus in heaven instead he did all that to give to people ability of theosis and inheritance of gods kingdom whether this ability is reclaimed and person is saved and not go to hell depends on persons free will and what they truly believe in their heart which is expressed by their actions in their lives on earth acceptance of gods truth by becoming members of his one true church by being orthodox baptized other heretic baptisms as catholic etc are invalid even if some orthodox priests who are in places where orthodoxy is not very common say otherwise and chrismated also this two things are necessary in order to be able to commune with holy spirit and then jesus christ and actually see god himself and his uncreated light from this life on earth and having correct lifestyle which includes gods commands and participation in liturgical mysteries and having spiritual father for guidance this belief that everyone will be saved just because they say they are christians is wrong it was made just because it is suits people as easy path and this is typical example of why all these diefferent heresies were created all known religions are either manmade paganistic phylosophies hinduism or heretic ideologies protestantism catholicism islam influenced by revelation of god by god himselforthodoxyhistorically precedes all its heresies and islam too which is influenced by orthodoxy too anyway where truth is changed falsified misquoted and manipulated in order to conform to sinful prejudices and to enforcement of authority of different people that made them pope mohammed belief that every belief is true and correct as long as someone refers to word jesus is wrong truth and gods presence and grace is only in orthodoxy people do not know this things and continue to be misleaded from generation to generation also other proof is miracle of holy light at day of celebration of resurrection in easter which always is done by orthodox patriarch until today and one time in history in 1549 ad when heretics did not let orthodox patriarch perform miracle and tried to do it by themselves miracle did not happen and pillar next to orthodox patriarch opened and holy light came out illuminating only his candles emir watched events from minaret of mosque opposite temple and shouted one is true god god of christians i believe in risen christ then muslims caught him and beheaded him his holy relic is kept to this day in holy monastery of great virgin of jerusalem crack of pillar located in middle column to left of entrance to complex of holy sepulcher is 120 meters high and it looks like rising flame from then on heretics gave back to orthodox bishop right to do miracle himself biggest proof is that in all this religions people can not see god but in orthodoxy god can be seen directly experienced with all senses eaten and drunk uniting directly with baptized persons heart by sacrament of holy eucharist and personal existencial relationship and communication with god theosis and experience of heaven and gods kingdom can be achived by this life on earth as main element of orthodoxyfor second part some things that help are channel trisagion films which has videos about orthodoxy and lives of saints in english and movie of life of saint joseph hesychast which is available in english in youtube byzantine music and hymns book great gerontikon and lives of saints elder ephraims of arizona monasteries throughout us who is most probably to officially declared saint in recent future holy mountain of athos and vatopedi monastery and its youtube channel pray to god by your own words or with known orthodox prayers as much as you can in order to start feeling grace inside your heart learn about unceasing prayer of mind and heart jesus prayerand most importantly find spiritual father for guidance start having correct lifestyle which includes gods commands and learn as much as you can by studying participate in liturgical mysteries of church when you feel ready be orthodox baptized other heretic baptisms as catholic etc are invalid even if some wrongly say opposite and chrismated 2 things necessary to be able to commune with god and see god himself and his uncreated light from this life on earth and achieve theosis and for later to be able to inherit gods kingdom only purpose of all those things is to help person achive complete communion personal existencial relationship that happens with all our beingbody and soul with god theosis as outcome of former and experience and inheritance of heaven and gods kingdom gods presence first from this life and then for eternity in other life by sacrificing only thing that we havecan produce by our selves which is our free will as god given abilityevery other thing either comes from grace of godhis presence or absence of grace of godhis absence free will ability to accept or reject presence of god in uswe are like mechanical machine we can do certain things that are similar to things god himself doesif good as we are images of godand this only because god created us that way but only if we have necessary fuel in us which in this case is grace of god if we are speaking about good things or absence of grace of god if we are speaking about bad thingsthere is no empty space in spiritual word but empty space of absence of god is filled with opposite traits of god which are evil things every good thing is ray of light of gods infinite uncreated light and every bad thing is absence of ray of light of gods infinite uncreated light

21 pounds in 21 days is possible with low enough intake over that time half of that weight is water and glycogen and will go straight back on after 21 days but you can get reading on scale that low for man fasted weight loss is around 06 lbsday so 126 lbs and can lose around 8 pounds of water if you go from fully fed to this kind of restriction as you use up your glycogen stores and your cells dump sodium both of which cause you to shed water plus pound for glycogen itself it is not good plan and science is bunk but that claim itself is plausible if very misleading with starvation diet

i have recently tried skipping out on breakfast and lunch and just eating big meal at end of day semi keto semi carnivore but i do allow for some sweets i gave tried calorie tracking before and meal prepping but having to have lunches packed and ready everyday takes lot of effort it is easier for me to buy some steak and eggs or salmon freeze it let it thaw then come home after working and have nice big meal it is more convenient for me than planning out entire weeks worth of meals and making sure i bring something to lunch because when i miss day i still feel like i need to eat at work so i will grab lunch or get snack and it will cause me to fall off wagon yes this message is scattered last year i started watching your videos and felt inspired to lose weight i tracked calories diligently for about 4 months and lost about 40lbsbut demands of my job caught up i was working lot of double and mg sleep was suffering i did not have time to prep meals i was stressed and decided to just give up and started eating out again id stopped going in mg afternoon walks i stopped trying i gained everything back and that makes it so much harder to want to try again because i know just how long it will take to get back to where i was i think secret be to not just stick to one approach calorie counting or intermittent fasting or particular diet but to be adaptive to change right now 1 meal day strategy seems to be working but i feel like i need to be flexible thanks for reading if indeed you did and i love your channel

was trying to wait until end to comment but when you got to doctor calling megan question_symbol biggest failure i had to stop and cry i am obese and in 2005 nearly lost both legs in car wreck my recovery was hard about year of constant physical therapy break more surgery more pt rinse and repeat one day i had pt shortly after visit with doctor and i was so depressed i started telling my pt that doctor had said if you ever walk with just walker or crutches i will consider you success in context of conversation he made it clear that he did not expect me to even achieve that much i am crying telling my pt this while we work and he starts laughing at me i was like what question_symbol exclamation_symbol question_symbol exclamation_symbol question_symbol exclamation_symbol pt said what are you doing right now question_symbol i was going up and down staircase using handrail and cane that a$$hole doctors words were so strong that i not even see that i had outdone his expectations if i had not had such great relationship with my pt if he had not been just most awesome person ever i probably have given up that day later on i had another doctor mock my asthma attack and tell me i should just kill myself and that conversation was not as harmful as first onepeople do not like mirrors put together 2 people who you think are exactly alike and they will dislike each other because all they see in other is their own faults and weaknesses two besties that were going through same thing and one changes their life that is convicting other is immediately faced with i should be able to do that too and has not weight loss journeys are like kids people want baby being smallerhealthier but they do not want diaper changes sleepless nights etcthe work to get there they accept all kinds of excuses as to why they cannot make change and when someone they know does it it puts lie to their excusewe have to learn to succeed that we can be success many of us have so much experience being failures that we really do not have any expectation of success even with littlest tasks we have to train ourselves to remember that we can accomplish stuff and to expect that we will succeed we tend to set unreasonable nonspecific goals with no plan how to reach them like vague get healthy resolution because we do not actually know how to get there and do not expect to recently saw short where dude said one reason we selfsabotage is so we are mentally prepared for consequences and can control our hurt he was talking about relationships but i think it applies to all harmful behavior if i say i am going to get skinny there is not one person including me who can believe that so no one is disappointed when i fail however if i just make one choice at time teaching myself that i can change and do better little at time i train myself to believe what i say i will do and each act becomes affirmation of what i can achieve it took nearly year of going to gym weightlifting and walking 3 days week adding in some exercise classes 2 days week tracking my food and making better choices for me to actually believe i will succeed at losing weight and getting healthier

i disagree with lot of your opinions but i watch you because i think it is important to watch people you disagree with because it makes you question things which is important since watching your videos it is made me realize that i do not need to feel bad for losing weight it is my body and i am allowed to do what i want with it since then i have lost 20 pounds and i have started doing pilates every morning which has actually helped alot with my mental illnesses weight loss has also helped alot with my confidence i wish i have been confident at my bigger size but unfortunately i can change my opinions but i can not change world and being able to shop at more stores has had impact as well on my wellbeing i really became indoctrinated by body positivity and i think there definitely needs to be more healthy medium no one should feel bad for losing weight if it is done in healthy manner that makes you feel better

i do not think i can tell someone how to lose weight since i have never had these problems but if i was to give advice it be to reduce amount of unhealthy habits and intentionaly create good habits like for example last year i realised that after finishing university andstarting work i was getting in worse shape over time when that happened i did not go to gym instead i started jogging like 12 km day did like 10 push ups and that was it i also started intentionally avoiding any unhealthy food reasonably though i try to eat mostly home made meals or something in fancy restaurants that it whole food nothing artificially processed other than that i eat aa much as i feel like and have greatly incresed amount of exercises now i feel much better it is going back to 1618 year old body when i was sorta athletic nothing special though but do about 2530 pull ups for example i think it is good way to improve your health in long run just avoid extreams

i have in my possession two books one called commonsense cookery book reprinted in 1962 but it is older than that it has lot of recipes about brain and other parts of animal that we do not eat in many recipes and another book called colonial cook book most of recipes are from news clippings and book was first published in 1864 there is so much use of every part of animal and so much fat lard and other animal products that you cook with used my grandmother also used to cook when my mum was young most of these foods oxtails brains lots of liver everything was cooked in some kind of fat one thing when i was child that she did do is lard was always kept and reused until it was unusable she never cooked any of these recipes when i was kid maybe if i had known i have asked her too family were in middle class and my nana was stay at home mother to four there was also historical study that found now i am probably going to quote it wrong but it was 100 or more soup recipes that women in middle ages had to learn in england before they got married each one had for different health benefits or ways to help their husbands there is also fishmonger in melbourne who sells fish and then shop right next door that he owns he uses every part of fish to make food for people and it is getting quite popular

you explained concept of intuitive eating quite precisely and although you speak quite critically about haes in one of your videos you just pointed out some of main principles around haes food advice eat when you are hungry stop when you are full include feelgood movement eat fibre enjoy your meal with all senses what certain instagram culture made of this inclusive movement and its good intention well i share your criticism at some point by way these principles equal principles of intuitive eating such facts combined with audios for subconscious changes 1 eat when you are hungry 2 eat what makes you feel happy and healthy 3 enjoy your meal and trust your hunger signals 4 stop when you feel adequalely satiated started both haes theory and intuitive eating practice to get back in line with my body and to make peace with it most ironically lost weight with it now i am combining both aspects and write about haes and bodyrelated topics in my blog among other topics another fun fact at this point in earlier times social pressure and negative feelings led to emotional eating my intuitive eating programme steps into subconscious part of emotional eating and since i have been practising this idea theoretically it was known to me through haes same negative emotions result in total lack of appetite so i must force myself to eat then sorry long post but be helpful for you

only problem with your stupid bs argument ben is that your basis for it is based in some made up bullshit about floaty dude in sky that lives in castle of gold and if you worship him enough you will go there when you die you supporting abolishment of all forms of abortion means that women who are going to have fatal delivery or child that will be born into pain and disability and never have life worth living all those options to abort dangerous pregnancies will go with it you are fkn idiot to say that there is no legitimacy in any abortion

i have feeling that big food is behind push for fat acceptance and 600lb setpoint stances i think if we follow those threads back to their origins we'd end up in corporate boardroom in mix of pr brainstorming session on how to change narrative around fact that their incredibly cheap nutrient void highly addicting chemical concoctions they gleefully label as food is causing obesity crisis
not eating meat on fridays was because…the fishing industry needed boost that had nothing to do with god
my take is fat positivity is just extremist group that has given up on improving themselves it is dedication and work to be healthy but they are so incredibly insecure that they have to convince others that are also overweight that living this unhealthy life is more beneficial so they do not have to actually have to try work at anything if they put as much energy in trying to convince people to stay on this path of selfdestruction imagine what they do if they actually tried to lose weight
as obese person who has lost weight multiple times i have lot to say ex fat people are harshest group of people toward fat people i know this from first hand experience both from 1 being victim of ex fat person fatphobia and 2 going through that same psychological process that makes ex fat people feel that way when they lose weight i dont think being fat gives anyone out of being fatphobic its ingrained in our society just like racism also most people are not saying that being fat is due to genetics and socioeconomic upbringings instead of choices we are to point in our development as society where we can see and acknowlege that genetics environment and socio economic status have huge inputs on persons abilities to make decisions its not one or otheryoure strong reaction to these groups of people is what gives off vibe that you hate fat people i see it clearly bc ive been there most people who look to fat activists are just normal people seeking sympathy in world that gives them nothing but tough love and pull yourself up from boot straps energy you know what that feels like and you used that energy to transform your life which is fantastic and i am really happy for you but not everyone is you not everyone thrives with that type of pressure there is countless conversations that have been had about this at end of all this i just want to say im not mad at you i have been you its very easy to defend position youre taking its more work to accept fat people as fellow human beings who deserve compassion but i promise its worth iti still struggle with internalized fatphobia but where i am now is much happier place where i can give all versions of myself compassion and understanding thats truly life changing

god is not human being he does not punish he does not kill he does not hate he does not seek revenge he does not make anyone suffer he does not allow anything near hell to exist or demonic devil of evil to exist god loves and his actions follow suit in that heshe is not like us when we are out of spirit and let us face it most of us are out of spirit in our actions most of time bible is wrong on many counts and accounts yet at times it is correct it cannot be last word on god and spirituality it was made by well meaning people most of them to keep order in confusing murderous world of people gone wild and it worked…until it was then used to create more strife more rivals groups and more division
honestly think they did her more harm than good only thing that benefited her change was exposure and accountability them purposely sneak feeding her ham was horrible i am glad you brought attention to many of other factors that explain persons food addiction but you did not discuss way those foods act on her brain carbs give us rush fats make it last longer so even eating this few times week make you crave it so you feel that good again she has years of memories of this food combo being safe delicious and making her feel good that is something that will take long time of continuous effort to counteract

it is great that you have had 303 so much success as much you motivate and encourage others to succeed on their journeys to health that is great thing i believe that obesity is unhealthy research does show that there is strong genetic component to obesity there are also significant socioeconomic indicators of health that underlie obesity my knowledge of obesity is that it is result of complex combination of factors it is not just matter of personal willpower or inner strength in fact my view of many obese people is that they have tried multiple times to lose weight and that it takes tremendous courage to keep trying even if failure seems likely i respect them for that and never demean anyone for failure yes obesity can be overcome it is not impossible but this will never occur as result ofany kind of denigrationagain since your videos inspire others in positive manner i applaud you

1205 to say it is not at all about willpower but rather strategy or something else is not true you are normally rational but as is commonly case when people get blinded by commercialism eg selling product in this case your program their objectivity and respect for truth become compromised plus their wording becomes less precise and filled with absolutespeople can easily control elephant for example stop eating m@sturbating nofap etc using willpower alone for example i was addicted to sugar especially soda but started having reactive hypoglycemia it was manageable and i was not yet diabetic but i gave it up without issue for years i even store it cold in my fridge for my family and never drink it despite it being visible cool and easily accessiblei am not bragging i am simply pointing out that almost everyone is capable of immediately and permanently ending lifelong addiction cold turkey using willpower alone even if stakes are not all that high eg annoying but manageable episodes of reactive hypoglycemia not reaching for junk food having binges and so on can easily be done by anyone by no stretch of imagination is this comparable to trying to fight far stronger animal like elephant that is gross exaggeration and perfect example of defeatism blame game etc

ok ashley and amy do not you think that thin people have feelings too question_symbol question_symbol question_symbol question_symbol question_symbol question_symbol it is as if you are on bandwagon downing thin folks why i have never starved myself and i surely never whine about what others are or are not eating why i care question_symbol i myself practice keto and bullet proof meal plan not diet 90 percentage_symbol of time maybe more only because i feel amazing when i do not have all sugar in my body i have never in my life counted calories if size does not matter then why heck are you dwelling on it nonstop entire interview its as if it is your hook and mission to continue downing anyone that is not your large and it is old news when we stop bringing all attention to this expired message no one will give f seriously it is as if you are promoting fat and big girls big women and men unite message it is us against thin people how immature that is when you think about it i love when talk shows give rewards for people who is lost 100 pounds i am kidding i am not fan what about people who never gained 100 pounds in first place and loved their bodies enough to eat for nourishment and other healthy reasons where is their reward question_symbol do not want one just enjoy feeling good because feeling good is reward point is get over weight and size issues and complaining andyou have to ask amy what size she is that alone is irrelivant why do not we moveon to productive conversation that is much more exciting and interesting many of us do not care how big or small you are and if we do then we are one with problem silence is most powerful message and when you do not give it worth or value it fades fast when we stop caring about what others think of us then and only then we have really grown as whole i am just so tired of we are largebigfat and we love it message if think person were to say i love being thinprettysexy then we are bad guy and shame on usjust giving example here great you are big and love way it feels on you but let us move on and one last thing whole reverse casting in media etc now says if you are thin and pretty you are not real in casting many say we want real people wow that is sad that we have come to that another form of discrimination in reverse it is other side of discrimination and many will not recognize that because they are angrymadbitter and list goes on i have never hated on anyone because of way they looked or their size and yet this is where we are comparing everyone it is all backwards thinking and nonproductive and now if you say anything share how you feel it is considered political incorrect it is just wrong in way you dice it up you cannot breath in wrong direction anymore yes there are bullies and mean insensitive people on planet but only way we get past it is to start focusing on opposite and positives and how can we be best version of ourselves how can we give back what can we go better where is that convo question_symbol this conversation is so stale and selfinvolved and mentions nothing about giving sharing loving etc all you 2 discuss is your size and all issues that go along with it it is just not interesting and who is it helping by ranting and dwelling on obvious question_symbol i like you both lot and i was hoping for exiting and interesting interview but you lost my attention fast and this are just parting words i felt i share since there is comments section
i just do not get whole do not be so hard on yourself let go of perfectionism and do not linger on numbers do not be so strict and cut out entire foods but then it is you have to be in caloric deficit or else you wo not lose weight white processed foods are your worst enemy it is so mentally exhausting i lost weight 6 years ago and gained double it i lost 40 lbs last year and i still enjoyed foods i loved but managed to regain 30 of those lbs in last few months i am so lost and helpless i do not know
most people in us are fat because they still think 2000 calorie per day recommended diet still applies to modern timesit was created back when average person got tenth amount of calories from sugar and were far more active than people today even if they stick to 2000 calories which i highly doubt they wonder why they do not lose weight from exercise not understand recommendation already includes moderate exercise i also think lot of fat people will go eat out to place like applebee's and then think that what they are served is normal portion of food to eat 2 or 3 times day typically restaurant meal is enough calories to last entire day and then some

people confuse traits of narcissist way too often with traits of bpd or with plain old overcorrection of extremely low confidenceshe hates herself when she says she is great and all all she is doing is trying to convince herself you can tell she does not like herself at all in fact she dislikes herself so much that she is already confident beforehand that she will fail at losing weight
these comments are savage bro skullbut this is about only okay way to fat shame someone but skinny shaming 16 year old is not ok and fat shaming is not ok either not siding with jamie here i just think everyone deserves chance 3

i get why adults try to encourage children to try new foods it is good for them to do so but i will never understand why they attempt to force feed foods that are already known to make child gag all it does is create bad memory in best possible scenario or aversion and maybe even phobia in worst case my mom did same thing with me and fish in my case orange roughy not even deliciously cooked but steamed with no seasoning other than little margarine i was made to sit at table for hours choking it down as if it was punishment i even remember my mom seeming mad at me which makes no sense to me as adult i am 34 now and only over last five years or so have i worked up courage to try new seafoods that are actually well prepared i even love sushi now but for years i was afraid to try it thinking i gag
i feel like it is hard to get nuance into discussion about health 200 years after fact there is difference between quantity and quality of life and just because people were living to old age does not mean they were living to old age and being healthy elderly i be interested to see rates of cvd and cva in people who grew up in that golden period with so much consumption of saturated fat others have said in comments section here article does not discuss things like chronic disease and they are right too it is all good and well having robust immune system that can fight off infection but living under cloud of smog and sweeping chimneys from age of 5 is probably going to do number on your lungs and will put you at risk of conditions like copd and heart disease i think another thing people often do gloss over is chronic disease is not oneanddone problems like copd heart disease and chronic kidney disease etc can all be problems that take years to progress and manifest themselves as well you have to wait some time to see if someones intersection of environment and genetics will cause them to to develop cvd as example
suger doesnt cause weight gain directly fat does dairy like cheese milk etc are superfoods designed to make babies gain weight when you eat suger as well you use sugers 1st then other stuff like dairy get stored as fat too much suger while over weight means not all suger is being used and that causes type 2 diabetes reducing suger is good idea but stopping dairy is far more effective also dont eat on schedule only eat when your actually hungry most people have no idea what actual hunger is though

you are one of my comfort youtubers so i keep rewatching these videos over time i did not realize it first time watching but now i can see that it is so obvious that something similar was going on with my ex best friend and me way tammy speaks reminds me so much of her suddenly and especially way she speaks about amy is kinda similar to how this „friend spoke about me in my case it was not about weight loss but about psychological issues and how one handles their trauma it always kinda felt like competition like who had worst trauma who was bigger victim… she openly told me she was jealous of me many times and also how my trauma must not have been as bad as hers or else i not have been able to accomplish things i have which i do not have amazing life with tons of accomplishments i struggle with depression and everyday is fight for survival sometimes but i am not gonna give up on life and work really hard to maintain somewhat hopeful mindset and i am really grateful to still be here she always blamed someone or something else for her failures even when it was absolutely clear that sometimes it was just consequences of her behavior and she felt entitled to everything cause she had it so hard and everyone was out to get her supposedly it really hurt seeing my friend so unhappy and i was trying everything to be supportive but i struggle with my own issues and have limited capacity when i told her this she completely exploded and to this day is convinced that i amwas actively trying to sabotage herbut somehow it makes sense now why she is that way im glad to have herbeizubringende my life but i do not hate her and i really wish her all best and hopefully one day she will be able to self reflect about her behavior and create happier life for herself

to say i never eat sugar only shows how malinformed you really are about what you are actually eating since dextrose glucose and fructose are contained in just about everything you eat especially supermarket stuff all has added sugars in multiple forms properly educate yourself about what you put into your mouth first and then start questioning whether you are fat and perhaps discovering why then next big step is to get over selfdenial and selfpity and do something about what makes you unhappy 3

i am gonna be real with yall losing weight is challenging it took me 2 years to finally beat obesity and most of weight loss only started happening after few months there were many nights of feeling miserable for having craving i dreaded exercise but slowly learned to love activity in my own way worst part was looking in mirror and wondering if anything i was doing was actually going to work progress was slow but necessary it did not help me feel less ashamed in clothes or that i not eat certain foods oddly enough i made far more progress after learning to love myself unconditionally no matter what state my body was in learning to appreciate food from holistic sense really helped clothes part can still be challenge today even when people say i look good but that is okay i will work on that

on topic of food ordering apps i am on other end of spectrum anorexia bingepurge subtype i developed huge shame in people seeing me in relation to food and i hated purging in public restrooms i dont have car either so picking up food from my favorite binge spots in near impossible where i live so i turned to food delivery apps they made me spiral to crazy levels i was binging and purging multiple times everyday i was spending absurd amounts of money on food and delivery and because of this i was investing even less food than normal as my time was taken up binging and purging so i lost even more weight it was dark time in my life i swore off food delivery if i want to binge and purge i have to go get it and that has dramatically decreased frequency my general consensus food delivery apps are bad for everyone it should not be so easy to get food

i was born in slovenia it is ex yugoslavian country thats been independent since 1991 and fully joined eu in 2003 we were part of socialist regime before and very fast adopted western capitalism on paper everything was state owned before but in practice workers were real owners of every factory of every business salary gap between ceo of company and cleaner in company were not as crazy as todayone example is and i am talking this from my own experiences from being kid and teenager growing up in that regimemy father was electrician for big curtain factory and my mother was sales person in grocery store at end of year when business made more money then expected both of my parents received part of that money and every summer we went on one month vacation in croatia where accommodation was 100 percentage_symbol payed by company these summer houses were owned by governmentworkers so they got to use them my childhood memories were beautiful with my parents not being overworked as they became after these vacations were modest no 5 starts hotels and so its croatian places that are now being rented for 200€ per nightsomething that now 90 percentage_symbol of slovenian croatian families simply can never affordwith slovenia becoming independent and my parents being very motivated to create something of their own they started their own business in 90s with money that was quite easy to save during socialistic times they started with opening one car parts store and eventually added 4 more over years we were financially doing very well i guess you say we were rich my parents were extremely hard working and smart with money they build their own house out if city and even bought 2 big apartments that supposed to be for me and my brother so looking from outside everything was great but quality of life went extremely downhill my parents were overworked those one month vacations were gone simply because there was no time for that if we squeeze 6 days per year it was already lotwith parents being overworked health problems occurred thankfully we did not adopted western healthcare practices even now going to doctor is practically for freemy parents were stressed working 6 days per week my 7 years younger brother had luxury of getting lot of material things and opportunities that i has not he started lot of hobbies that he never followed trough but he missed on having happy parents that had time for him like for instance i had even though he had much more things i definitely consider myself as lucky one fast forward to today due to globalisation and foreign corporations majoring of slovenian businesses went bankrupt or were simply bought up by businesses from richer countries small country with less than 2 million of population on border of europe union simply cannot compete with richer bigger more established countries of eu one of biggest problems national problems based in my opinion is housing crisis prices are same as for instance in germany where i live now for 6 yearsexcept that average salary is 800€ net while in germany is 2300€ net even with very poor calculation skills you can determine that anyone owning and paying of apartment in their lifetime in slovenia is practically impossible this is my explanation of socialism based on experiences i collected while growing up in very interested era conversion from socialism to what i call disease that will end humanity mother and father of evil capitalism

what helped me change my relationship to food was intermittent fasting sure plenty of people binge eat into surplus during their window but for me it was huge to train my brain not to he eating all day every day now that hunger and craving signal does not even come on until lunch and it does not come on strong i eat plate of eggs for lunch like 300 calories and 25g protein and then do not get hungry until dinner where i finally have very large meal i eat my protein and fiber first at meal and can never seem to finish carbs because of that i do not even cook carbs sometimes knowing i am not going to eat them and rather just eat more meat anyways also yogurt is excellent snack sure it is full of sugar but if you use it to replace actual just sugary empty calories then you are at least getting some protein and vitamins while you succumb to your sugar cravingshonestly eat as much protein as you can stomach and there will not be much room for too many calories i am stuffed for hours after five eggs and it is 350 calories if you need to bulk up your meals pick whatever green veggies you like i love broccoli and can eat lot of it trick is do not be afraid to add some fatoil to nutritious foods they will taste much better and you are still getting their nutrients with essential fatty acid boost

tati exclamation_symbol you are my absolute favorite go to for accuracy in your descriptions and recommendations thank you exclamation_symbol i live in caribbean and have been having problems following seasonal trends fall and winter looks that hold up in heat and humidity i know you had some great tips whenever you are on trip but you go through your goodie closets for us snowbirds question_symbol red_heartred_heartred_heartred_heart
i believe fat people think that food they eat is more satisfying and tasty than eating healthily and eating healthily means eating food they do not like or even find disgusting but eating healthily is more tasty more fun makes you feel better and satisfy you because you are getting nutrients you need it gives you more energy to put that mental effort into choosing healthy work out how you can make eating healthily part of every day and eventually everything you eat we are so lucky to have internet that makes it easy to find healthy tasty and quick recipes also have one or two easy fallback meals for when you can not be bothered to choose for me that is chicken rice and broccoli swap out broccoli for whatever vegetable you like if you do not like broccoli
have not seen movie have not really been interested but now you have made me curious from what you have shared it seems like it is pretty accurate description of what you can expect if you become extremely obese i always have to remind myself that phobia does not just mean abnormal fear of something but also abnormal repulsion there is nothing abnormal about fearing effects of obesity and depression and nothing abnormal about repulsion towards someone killing themselves now those who simply look at overweight nonideal body and say eww gross exclamation_symbol simply because it is not pleasing to their eyes they are fat phobic but i daresay they are also in minority most people look with empathy and understanding concerned for well being of othersi really enjoyed your insights on how food cultureindustry of us is affecting our health i used to live in city with wide variety of restaurants everywhere and now live in rural area where aside from half dozen or so fast food joints most of which i loathe there are even less restaurants that have food that even rarely appeals to me those facts have not stopped me from picking up food at least for my husband once or twice week we live outside delivery area for pizza and afaik door dash does not reach us and i have never really thought about how we should be grateful for that instead of being annoyed that we have to get fully dressed leave our home and drive 30 minutes to grab junk
you should definitely apologize for being yourself especially if you are like that and are so fat you start to generate your own gravitational feild
same i was 260 at my heaviest i will never be skinny kid in my heart some of mycoworkers think of me as skinny guy despite fact that i do not have any veins my waist is 31 i have bad cardio etchearing that they think i am skinny does not really help in moment it make me feel better about myself but in long term it makes me only feel like fraud… i do not really handle compliments well because of time that i was fat and all fake compliments i got trying to get rise out of me no real affection for my entire teenage years through to adulthoodsince losing weight my confidence has gone up but not to level where i feel confident i just feel like i am constantly on verge of tears because i have no selfimage anymore and i have no idea who to trust

there are very differing opinions in carnivorous communities about who agrees or does not agree with paul saladino one diet is not for all paul works out lot if you do not you do not need same diet as him yes we ate few plants that is logical because if hunt did not succeed or went wrong or our meat storage was empty in winter times we did need ability to eat plants of some sort just not any of plants found in grocery store today we have developed them ourselves made them bigger and sweeter at end fact remains fat and glucose are fuel so choose one of them mixing them is detrimental for health and that is real problem with omnivore diet

there is similar docureality series as 600 lb life of british origin called fat doctorsome episodes of it is on you tube that series not as intrusive to people recieving surgery but they are interviewed in depth and one can notice they have already done some amount of mental and intellectual scrutinizing about their weight as to when why and whats around their weight and they also interview doctors more and also show more of medical procedure as such which some perhaps find gory in some of episodes where it is not blurred out but to some it be worth to see fat aprons they need to get by to get to stomach pouch covering but put burden on organs this especially since some fat tokers try to argue that visceral does not exist but even skinny people can have it

ego vs intuition basically discipline ego basically what answer every religion and philosophist came too i am glad people are noticing spirituality and such more just sad people are only now realizing it to come too surface people needing guidance remember lots of answer within meditation eating healthy anything that heighten intuition not ego there is reason christianity says we go to hell for indulging in cravings murder and so on but read it more metaphorically ego gets stronger whenever we feed it ego then suffers more reason why they use term hell if people read everything metaphorically you will notice lot of religionsway of life like buddhism hinduism christianity etc they were all talking about higher cosnciousness basically feeding intuition insteaddisciplining ego we knew it for 1000's of years most people just take religion too literally but really there is lot to learn about how psychè and ego works in mostly hinduism and buddhism christianity has been changed lot for propaganda purposes but old testament teaches more about it new one is bit more materialistic reason why some christians these days are waay too karen anyway if you do not feel like reading any religion you also check out carl jung he talks lot about shadow work and founded analytical psychology he is also one who studied unconscious state and so fourth like four archetypes like self persona shadow and animaanimus shadow being everything about yourself you do not see as positive and animaanimus which is masculine and feminine side anima is mans internal other feminine animus on other hand is womans internal other masculine balancing both can help you in creating stability like courage and on other side empathy lots of people these days are unbalanced either too fragile or too aggressive lots of it can stem from parents splitting up not having fathermother figure it can also stem from lots of processed food which is known to decrease testosterone in men not sure about women aggressiveness can also stem from too huge of ego something that alcohol increases which is why so many are depressed when drinking it all connects there is reason why religion looks down on alcohol and such psychedelics work other way diminishing ego helps you see world clearer without emotional fog and so on reason why psychedelics have helped so many people with addiction ego is what is addicted psychedelics also rewrites thought patterns making it easier to write healthy new one philosophy and religion always knew about it christianity just have muddied whole picture of what religion is hinduism and buddhism teaches about you how to overcome your mindego and live happy life all based on psychology and spirituality what people get wrong is that spirituality is about believing something that is not real yes christianity says this but spirituality is about reaching your higher self disciplining your ego and showing love and empathy which is all what intuition is about sure religion can be stories but hinduism and buddhism is way of life yes it does have stories but most read it literally and metaphorically example gods in hinduism all tells story gods are based on love death ego and so fourth reading through lines will make you understand gods are just metaphors for different emotions you have stories deepening your understanding of these emotions i am not religious i was atheist but now theist i have studied all of them and see similarities in all of them so i see how every religion can help you i do believe every god people have seen has been under influence of psychedelics though and that every god is same entity just people having different viewpoints on what higher power should look like are you christian and take mushrooms well you as well see jesus or something i am saying besides gods there are actual knowledge to living better life i do believe there is something higher but what i do not know all i know is that people has known how to live spiritual happy life centuries ago so there must be something giving them knowledge people have been known to have psychedelic experiences where they have been shown what happiness is and how to live by it easily said ego is what suffers enjoy little things have positive life but also disciplined one comfort is what ruins us this was really long but yeah it is all my knowledge though years connecting psychology psychedelics and religionspiritualitybeing uncomfortable also increases dopamine and other chemicals like norepinephrine which is why people do yoga ice baths meditation on spike mats and feel way better afterwards you should check out channels like sky life seek discomfort and yes theory they all got different examples of exposing yourself to uncomfortable things
one thing about binge eating for me was that i felt like i had to rush my meals i grew up being asked to hurry up and cram my mouth with heaps of rice so i be allowed to leave dining table as adult i had developed this habit well until last year when i learnt to slow down and take my time not only does it help me be aware of how full i am it also reminds me to actually taste my food another thing that i learnt by doing that was how salty my meals actually were i was stuffing myself with so much carbs and msg think rice thick sauces and deep fried dishes now i try to eat cleaner and it has reduced that heavy bloated feeling and i feel that this small habit has made such huge change in my eatingdiet mindset

as person who was dealing with anorexia and bulimia i feel offended what she did felt like mockery like telling me anyone can be anorexic it is madeup problem i was afraid to show my body in public i was anxious while eating food fat stigma i have experienced was hanging over me even when i was under 47g at 176m i doubt that she ever had anorexia because nobody who went through this shit make up stuff like thatthere is so much she be so much she have done for bodyacceptance movements and yet she is choosing to go after fame attention and spreading misinformation

it does not seem like you really understand psychology of being overweight person or what body positivity is though as well as some obese people you show in your videos your channel looks like you are just one of those fat shaming people who do not understand that talking about health consequences is not helping at all what helps these people is not just things like stop eating move more or pull yourself together and just do it but love and supporting environment activities they actually like doing good therapist respectful attitude supporting family etc because food addiction always has something to do with guilt stress coping eating up emotions because of inability to deal with them childhood traumas and low self esteem and other benefits from being overweight for our brain if i were you i rather stop just shaming fat people or do superiority talk on how you were overweight and point out other real side of problem why people get obese and why fat activist became what it is today
get off your pedestal white people eat processed foods too do not ever underestimate power of big food all of america is getting fat

i just wanna follow up on my previous comment and again i realize i am talking about being too skinny buti think this applies becausemy parents always tried to force me to eat and then gave in when i refused or sent me to bed as kid or say they take something away and i wanted bed that night anywaythings actually changed when they offered me dinner and it was optional i eat my frozen mealor if i like what they were cooking i join them andit was totally my choice eventually in this environment this was when i decided it not hurt in fact it help to join them once or twice week since my dad always cooks freshor at least healthier than what i eat optionsthe fat kids need that offer chance thankfully my parents did eventually realize keeping me at table was not answer they set deals for me as child and as adult they always ask how much i will actually eat and i eat any leftovers next daythis seems nuts but i used to be able see my ribs slightly i was not starving now i have actual belly that jiggles little bitbut if only these kids parents offer their kids option or i guess in this caselet kids offer them option exclamation_symbol my dad is cook in house but he did give us chances and while me and my youngest brother blew ours my middle brother actually does cook for our dad and even sometimes gets honor of being his sous chef to be fair though my dad does let me make green bean casserole for thanksgiving he always browns fries onions little too much and for some reason that dish is one of two dishes i can totally nail
only thing bigger than amount of evidence for obesity being dangerous is size of asses of people who push that narrative
i have found closer with my mom i get more reckless and impulsive i get closer with my dad i get i am reminded to be thankful and have manners and try and be nice and patient my dads always hugged me and loved me in public and he is pushed me to make friends and work and do good at school he listens to my choir music and asks about my day every day and i am sure that really started to pay off when i started to ask him about his too i come down to his home office sometimes and ask if i help him with work haha good fathers are sooo needed i lose my head if i only had my mom i be terrible human tbh

i actually disagree with lot of this filters aside these women these girls are crying over are putting in work these girls are not putting in they have their hair done they have their makeup on they are watching their nutrition they are working out they are dressing carefully and yes they are probably under filter or two these girls are just crying they are not even wearing any makeup i am not saying women must wear makeup to be beautiful but if you want to look like women wearing tons of makeup you are going to have to put some on even they do not look way they do wearing makeup when they are not wearing makeup you are not going to get same results if you are not putting in any of effort most blatant example significantly overweight girl in opening hugging herself as audio plays something like i wish i knew what it was like to be seen as beautiful fix your nutrition that is all you no do not run off halfcocked develop eating disorder recover and come back claiming all nutrition management efforts are toxic diet culture do it right you cannot expect same results when you are not putting in same efforts aspirational is but should not be four letter word either legitimately strive no crash diets shortcuts or other bullshit to be what you want to be or accept how you are without insisting others do too sorry bp body positivity obesity will never cute for example lets stop this headlong run for harrison bergeronstyle society

ayo i do not mean to force anything on anyone but we have various types of evidence for biblical events if anyone is interested read onnote i can not prove god to you it all comes down to your choice to put your trust in jesus christ that is all faith istrust unfortunately in these recent years science and religion as we know them today have bastardized each other and themselves point is faith is trusting in jesus it is not blind jump into what people deem irrational billy graham said something reminiscent of that i have no power over you i can only tell you but i can not force you i mean we are conversing online lol i am not at your location… yetjames 48 draw near to god and he will draw near to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you doublemindedhebrews 116 and

exclamation_symbol here is one example scientists have discovered that earth skipped daythe bible explains how that happened in book of joshua joshua asked sun to stop so he and israelites defeat their enemies then in 2 kings king hezekiah learned he was dying and pleaded to god to not let him die god sent prophet to king hezekiah who said hezekiah live hezekiah wanted sign and that be for sun

by intentionally losing weight you are erasing potentially fat body and by intentionally gaining weight you are erasing potentially normal body
i want to lose weight is because i was always obese as child until i got to middle school and decided i needed to become healthy after hitting 195lbs at 11 years oldi am back to being that weight pretty much and although i do not look as fat i hate what i have made my body become i hate that over last year and half i have gained just about 40lbs i hate that i was only slowly gaining weight after my anorexia from 105 to 125 i have slowly went from that to 135 then 145 then 150 then my weight skyrocketed junior yearjunior year was not tough year i was just overeating bc i did not want to tell my family i was not vegan anymore so i eat and eat and eat while i was at school during breakfast during lunch and break and even at work i hate it
those breakfast sandwiches sound disgusting

freedom of speech grown up
lot of people think that it is easier to lose weight and eat healthier by eating certain foods and limiting junk food but i have personally found that it is easier to have at least general plan for what to eat each day and track all food it leads me to make food choices based on whether it is worth calories both by nutrition and taste both are important evidence that this worked for me i lost 70 lbs from 265 to 195 at 6'4 i did not exercise in any way during this period although i definitely should have after i lost weight i started lifting weights and doing cardio few times per week and gained back another 25 lbs of lean mass muscle water glycogen over year and half and actually managed to lose more fat mass do with this anecdote what you will but perhaps it will help someone realize there is approach between trying to make better choices in moment and complete meal planning

here is unfortunate fact 1 lb fat in body can be processed into 3500 calories so if you were to lose 69 lb fat in 2 weeks you need to eat nothing and burn over 17000 calories per day even michael phelps or tour de france racers do not burn that much
it always saddens me when people talk about glycemic index but not glycemic load exclamation_symbol glycemic index is calculated based on 50g of carbohydrates for all foods with raw carrots for example one entire pound of carrots is only 45g of carbs so to get gi measurement they accounted for more than entire pound of carrots what is last time you sat down to meal of more than whole pound of carrots question_symbol glycemic load takes serving sizes into account so for glycemic load they take measurement based on 2 small raw carrots for example rather than over pound of carrots gi is still good metric to look at but it does not give accurate picture because it does not factor in realistic serving sizes

kim said it herself that kylies products suck lol
she probably has eating disorder but definitely not anorexia i say she probably has binge eating disorder where she cannot control how much she eats bingeeating disorder is condition where people lose control of their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food unlike bulimia periods of binge eating are not followed by purging excessive exercise or fasting as result people with binge eating disorders are often overweight or obese i heard her say at 335 roughly that she will not eat all day and then binge at night which is common in binge eating disorder and bulimia so imo it is not anorexia but probably another ed
i am recovering alcoholic and because i drank my calories i have very complicated relationship with food idea of being addicted to eating something you have to do to stay alive is really scary because i know what it feels like to think you need your substance food addicts need to eat like anyone else if i had to take couple shots every day i never stop drinking i am trying really hard to unlearn my judgement of overweight people genetics and science of fattening food has lot to do with it but i also remember how i felt when i drank thousands of calories of whiskey week world is scary and sucks and it is getting worse and we all cope in different ways

interesting as t1d since 1972 aspartame was pretty much forced on me if i wanted diet soda like tab at time as i got older i heard rumors and various discussions about aspartame that it causes cancer only in super high doses and some have allergiclike reactions those same rumors were around with saccharin too which was also one of only options available for those like me today nutrasweet is stevia and erythritol blend using rebaudioside m component of stevia that is supposedly sweeter and less bitter personally i am not huge fan of flavor of stevia and erythritol gets tricky with weird cooling sensation in some recipes and amounts i can say aspartame being one of few sweeteners i was able to take advantage of so long ago and is still in some diet sodas i have never knowingly had any issues or concerns with blood sugar impact being my primary concern today while i do still drink lots of zerosugar stuff like pepsi 7up etc i prefer to use allulose in almost everything i cook if dish needs to be sweet really great job with research details and walkthrough thank you for putting this out there exclamation_symbol

hello thanks for your amazing work red_heartat 35 years old and as former bulimic binge eater emotional eater i agree with what you said in this videothe importance of sleep is so neglected i can tell that good sleeping totally changes whole f game with hunger and mood thoughout day nearly one year now that i go to bed at 1030 pm and wake up at 7 am more or less i feel less anxious and i can eat peacefully my first meal at 1pm i am not hungry at all in morning eating in morning makes me feel bad and nauseous which allows me to experiment intermittent fasting allowing my digestive system to rest and it is soothing my mindwhile i was searching for tips to stop bingeating nice advice bit bisturbing at beginning was having full nice meal good plate one that allows you to feel you have eaten well nice way to eat loooot of vegetables without shame and it worked for me no need to throw back my meals anymore no need to worry about blowing fuse anymore and open fridge and food storage and make carnage anymore i rather eat big plate than eating all day longi do not eat lot of white sugar cakes and sweets anymore just from time to time and they taste now so nasty i eat very dark chocolate one or two biscuits with my coffee for lunch and one after my dinner with my herbal spiced infusion or green teadrink lot coffee or tea in morning green tea and natural organic infusions no flavors no artificial flavors i recommend pukka ones or yogi tea and watervegetal food helped me lot not that i do not want to eat meat but i do not see point in putting bad quality meat in my body poor earthling suffered his life long and in end industry adds flavors and sugars salt and coloring and conservative additives and spice extracts not even just spice no spice extractsflushed_face etc from time to time i eat good quality meat when i find some organic local eggs and fresh goat cheese are delicous tooexercising also helped me lot to have feeling of clarified mind wich was very sweet and agreable less pain satisfaction of evolving and succeeding in doing stuff that you were not able to do before feeling your blood circling fast all inside instead of watching tv or being depressed in your bed stretching blisssmall habits helps washing my teeth when i am done eating helped me too it means eating is over and i just go and do something else reading drawing painting working and it is satisfiying to focus on something without interrupting yourself with pulse go to f fridge and again start eating like there is no tomorrowreading labels food composition is reflex now and when i see that list is long with added sugar and useless stuff where there should'nt be i do not buy product and i do not miss it at all i hope you american friends are able to find healthy stuff not expensive as f and not polluted as fnow i tell myself that i experimented fast and junk food and normal food too in waaaaaaay tooo enormous amounts well enough and now it is time to just eat simple stuff and that is delicious and healthyi also told myself that wasting all of my money on so many food was insane it lasted about 12 years flushed_facemy throat that began to hurt all time my nasty breath and horrible stomach pain day after worried me and disgusted me of what i was inflicting to my body mind soul etcthe last time dentist told me that my teeth were quite used for my agemy liver hurting strangely kind of strange pain and heavy weight on right side of bust and caracteristic breath that comes with liver problems so good red_heart also helped me realize and being aware being aware and conscious also is very very important that i die sooner than scheduled in atrocious paini can say that i am done with binge eating or throwing back my food losing weight was my goal when this nightmare began to intensify now my weight is stable even if i am just little overweight it does not matter food is still important to me but i am not obsessed anymore and from time to time i eat half pizza or ice cream with delight and that is ok no shame no guilt no nothing i am done i am in f peacei wish to all of you that struggle everyday with this s to get out of it to find your way out of dark it is possible it is sometimes messy as f but in end it works and you will be f proud that this s is far behind be strong flexed_biceps you can do it you deserve peace

children are conditioned into eating certain foods there will be some foods child dislikes but in general if you give them balanced diet they will eat what they are told to fast food is treat not diet my children were sent to bed without pudding if they did not eat their dinner i did not fry food it was either baked boiled or steamed for their drink during meal it was either apple juice orange juice or milk otherwise or they have squash or water trust me when i say child will not allow itself to starve if presented with healthy tasty food giving your child fast food as staple diet is cop out by parent you get out what you put in
not sure where this falls in whole selfdeception or secret eating category but i have trouble losing weight due to psych issues i had complete mental breakdown and lost ton of weight unhealthy amount in fact i had to be forced to eat now that i have recovered i am obese every time i try to lose weight and start seeing results i self sabotage because being thin in my mind equates to being sick i have not managed to break through that psychological barrier yet no obeserelated health scare has hit hard enough to overpower that initial belief
no matter adeles size she is beautiful strong woman tabloids are scum
according to me body positivity is not mocking someone for hisher looks height weight hair etc every obese person knows that she is fat and need to weight loss but for some people losing weight is tough maybe because of thyroid pcod or other disease we need to be supportive and empathetic to them but some people misunderstand body positivity and thinks that being fat is fine no it is not your body is temple and start worshipping it otherwise we cant adapt tha changing climate

as 14 year old girl that lost 20kg from 8060 in last 45 months i find your videos be very helpfull i sadly found your channel after i already got my stuff together it started because i was doing research and project on personality that helped me become more open minded and started analyzing my behavior i found out that my over eating stemmed from fact that i was just sadbored and playing video games all day luckily this enlightening happened just before summer break so i put my full effort into loosing weight i first started with getting myself busy and being productive i personally feel lot happier and emotionally satiated when i have had productive day and can go exhausted to bed so i was helping my dad construct our house all time except when i had to eat switched my old stuff for low calorie high volume food and also i started playing tennis every other day so i had 700900 active calories daily when school started it first did not really impact me just switched out construction work to studying more sadly my active calories droppedcrying_face but i have recently had little bump in road i got sick so no tennis but this was still ok cause i was putting all my energy this week into biology seminar next week i went to school but still no tennis but still working on seminar but i started eating really poorly for like 3 weeks and gained 2 kg but i got it under control and already lost those 2kg back also i started going to gym with my friend half week ago i think it is gonna substitute tennis because it is getting cold and tennis is really expensive tbh and i do not think i can suport tennis gym and getting good grades and placing in competitions
i do not think i have ever seen anyone else with fat roll on their forehead that makes me think there is more than just eating disorder like not there have to be some metabolic or genetic factor in that question_symbol i am not trying to be rude or disrespectful identifying factors beyond just behavioral can be major part of successful treatment and congratulations to her for making positive lasting change

holy crap i am type 1 diabetic and i did not know that it is actually endocrinology why i see my blood sugar tank when i am cooking meal i am really anticipating and i am starving by time i finally sit down i have learned to be careful not to overeat on accident i am one of those people i guess i have continuous glucose monitor and it is been wild watching patterns over last three years after drastically changing my lifestyle let us just say i took my a1c from 10 to 60 my other stat i am proud of is going from 260 lbs to 180 and still going i am also frankly disappointed in my care team for never giving me half as much information as was contained in this video i had to figure out that high glycemic index foods spike my blood sugar myself and do research on what foods not on my own i got there eventually i am just glad i am healthier now at 35 than i was at 25 winking_face thanks for letting me toot my horn little genuinely fantastic video exclamation_symbol
it is same thing for people who are underweight anorexic too many of them will say i am healthy or it is lifestyle or even i am not underweight or worse i am fat exclamation_symbol they do not believe they are withering away they believe they are most obese person in room eating disorders are all like that based in selfdeception and delusion it is also just like food addiction only on opposite end of spectrum instead of lying to others that they are on diet anorexic nervosa patients will lie that they did eat and they will lie to you me their parents their doctors everyone real question is how does one even talk to someone who is delusional whether they are deluded into not believing their overweight or underweight question_symbol how does one get them to see that they are severely underweight that they need help or that they can die at any moment because of it question_symbol i do not know answer all i know is that it is sad for many addicts that recover sometimes it is not even matter of hitting rock bottom they say that addicts will change when they want to change so how can we even begin to help anorexic or obese people see their unhealthiness question_symbol delusions are just that no amount of data or proof will undo delusion person themself will have to be one to overcome it i do not know one person on this planet that knows how to hurry up that overcome delusion process though in order to save lives

chances are you have been through life and death before some have been through it lotthe church once believed in reincarnation until some pope in venice decided that he wanted to take holy parts of holy bible out and censored it
lot of these fat acceptance people take half of fact they kinda heard and run with it like being super lean 247 is unsustainable for most people because to do that you either have to be on tren or in calorie deficit both of which will cause health problems if continued for long period of time it is healthy to have some fat on you however healthy range is 1830 percentage_symbol depending on gender and genetics some peoples bodies just work different though between 25 and 30 percentage_symbol can still be healthy so long as ur eating healthy drinking enough water and exercising enough clean bulks are not gonna cause any significant health problems there is point when it is too much or how lot of them say that 90 percentage_symbol of time dieting does not work i have heard eating healthy at all does not work too and that person is gonna die which is true in reference to fad diets and changing your entire diet cold turkey making slow and gradual changes finding healthy recipes you enjoy not being super restrictive and meal prepping at least one meal every week is key to long term success reason why fad diets do not work is because people who do them do not understand nutrition and will just go back to eating how they used to after they have lost all weight reason why cold turkey does not work is because it leads to burnout it is same reason being super restrictive does not work and on people it does it also borders on disordered eating and often t here is correlation with unhealthy relationship with food im not talking about athletes or something temporarily being super restrictive before like weigh in or show or something im talking about instagram nutritionists who are like you can not eat bread seed oil meat vegetables water milk ect they are also same ones who drink bleach because they believe it gives them health benefits basically jilly juice mfs

instead of traditional pasta dishes i make grilled chicken bits with spicy seasoning and mix of veggies with some corn and then fraction of serving of pearled couscous and mix it together pasta couscous makes up very small amount of overall food and paired with small amount of corn it is very filling other veggies broccoli carrots peppers etc and chicken make up most of dish i use little canola oil and occasionally tablespoon of butter total in amount that has 23 servings not perfect dish for health but quite healthy especially compared with large plate of spaghetti or whatever you be indulging in too frequently high in protein low in refined carbs comparatively with other pasta dishes and fairly high amount of fiber depending on how many veggies you use but it not satiate your hunger as much if you are pounding refined carbs and junk food throughout day if you are being pretty healthy throughout day this is great meal
