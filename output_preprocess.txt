i'm 60 i started 3 years ago when i realized i had allowed myself to become very unhealthy and 350lbs i was always tiny bit heavier than other kids but it never stopped me from doing everything they didmy parents were healthy eaters and did not allow fast food or junk food i ate healthy my portions were too large and i did eat fast food and junk away from house not lot but enough to hurt me at 19 i lost 100lbs and stayed between 180 to 160 for years i never dieted or took diet medication i just watched what i ate and i was activemy husband was diagnosed with dementia in 2014 and i let myself go again 350lbs so i went back to eating healthy with smaller portions stayed away from junk food i'm lucky in fact that i don't like fast food or going out to eat i like to cooki'm 207 and still loosing i removed almost all gmos and gluten along with eating organic and 100 percentage_symbol grass fed meat i do believe that horrible chemicals that are allowed into our food cause many problems to our health it's lifestyle not diet and there are many healthy foods that taste wonderful if you want to loose weight you can you really can it's mind set but you can do it

last i've just realized i was at moment considered overweight and it was panicking me because everyone around me told me that losing weight is really hard and that you need to be hungry all time to make it works but since i was overweight i decided i wanted to lose weight and be in control of my health i started following you and other channels that spoke about how to lose weight and critics fat acceptance movement now almost 1 year afterward i'm very proud to say that you helped me lose 22 lbs (10 kg) and i'm not overweight anymore perfectly normal i'm still trying to lose extra 11lbs but i'm ok with them thank you for your channel exclamation_symbol )))

strangely enough we're told in uk we were at our healthiest during ww2 due to food rationing no obesity and poor were guaranteed meat in their diet on regular basisyet at same time meals people invented during rationing are bloody disgusting meals people associate with britain today long after they've gone out of regular usage
this is why when i want to lose weight i eat healthy stuff first i don't forbid other stuff i just eat healthy meal first which does signal my brain that it's full so if i do have bit of something junky it's only bit and it's not compulsive i don't feel restricted this way but it does take few days for good food to start signaling to your brain that you're full in first days i feel way hungrier and it takes me bit to feel full earlier

idk if anyone else has had experience like this but even when i wasn't attempting to lose weight i binge - and we're talking stretches of time like weeks or months on end of 3000 calories day - but in my case i was maintaining my healthy weight not gaining now i do run quite lot but missing puzzle piece is actually type of food i'm prone to binging on pretty much always nuts and nut butters so otherwise healthy whole foods that were extremely high in fat i found out through ultrasound for something else that i had massive gallstone which explain both types of foods binged on and lack of weight gain i'm hesitant to get my gallbladder taken out because doctors keep telling me i'm likely to still have many of same digestive problems afterwards so that's where i'm at but in case there's someone watching this who is frustrated because their binge eating doesn't fit this pattern like mine didn't and they don't know what to do i just want them to know there can be medical reasons that you're binging so do talk to doctor you're also at higher risk of gallstones if you're overweight or have lost lot of weight neither applied to me so it was just sheer luck that i was ever diagnosed

it be more useful to discuss hormonal and bilogical components of weight gain focus on obesity is focus on aesthetic if health is what you care about discuss health there is subtle but important distinction as person who was fat and lost weight people gave no fucks about my health when i was fat and when i lost weight i simple became easier on eyes and that's all that mattered also your thumbnails of excessively obese people can read as dehumanization and caricature of community you are trying to help just think maybe about if yourtarget audience leaves your channel feeling shamed or empowered (not to say they don't) great well researched content exclamation_symbol i'd love to even see some content about insulin resistance pcos etc etc etc since many of those factors affect "obesity" other part of this is i recommend some class analysis race analysis even making obesity individual and behavioral issue screams that perhaps you be missing something important

ticks are not invasive species as whole there are some species of ticks that are invasive such as asian longhorned ticks that have been introduced to north america but there are also many species of tick native to north america and ticks are important part of their ecosystems just like sharks they are major part of foodwebs and they also help control populations of animals by infecting them ticks are also easy to study proxy for overall ecosystem health and scientists frequently use tick populations to determine overall ecosystem health i bet person that privated her channel did so after being called out for what sounds like completely bs story if tick eggs hatch in your home you have infestation of larval ticks which are size of grain of sand average person looking at infestation of larval ticks wouldn't know what they were also cow killed by "super ticks" which are asian longhorned ticks was not adult cow and it didn't die of exsanguination it died of anemia all five of cows mentioned in article that died from tick infestation belonged to same farmer who clearly was not practicing proper pest control and his herd not have been very healthy to start withall that said ticks are very unpleasant creatures and it is important to avoid getting them on yourself your family and your pets when possible important note on that subject tick repellents don't necessarily repel ticks they just hide you from tick so it will ignore you even if you're wearing repellent and treating your pets it is still necessary to do tick check after any time outdoors

just saw documentary it was fascinating to see part of my childhood deconstructed like that still i'm not sure i agree with general idea that backlash against brand and effects are "good" first of all there wasn't really any karmic punishment here there was no comeuppance man was making 40 million year for while and then quit working with 27 million dollar retirement payout he won he's winner second while i definitely agree that certain aspects of company needed to come under scrutiny and needed to be eliminated (the treatment of models or sexualization of teenagers for instance) i don't think trying to force brand to cater to everyone at risk of being destroyed by public outcry was good strategy abercrombie was built on one idea of what ideal all-american looklifestyle is people who disagreed with that idea who found themselves excluded from it for their skin color religion or body shape have come together to build new brand that took same idea and expressed it in way that was inclusive without trying to force notion that traditional very conservative very preppy very white idea of americana needs to die why question_symbol why can't people who still feel that way have businesses that cater to them question_symbol why isn't there room for more than one idea of american identity question_symbol if you don't feel like business fits you take your money elsewhere why do you have to actively try to destroy it so you can feel validated at all times in all places by all people question_symbol like i know chick-fil-a doesn't like me i know it doesn't want my business i'm not going to picket to try to force them to do it i'm just going to buy my chicken elsewhere will i let other people know about things i disagree with about chick-fil-a question_symbol sure but if they choose to still go there i'm not going to cry about it and start protest

sixty years ago when i was kid we had sugary cereals candy cookies etc yet in my household we had nutritious meals and healthy snacks such as fruit raw vegetables and dried fruit my parents never brought that stuff into house carbonated beverages were rare treat purchased at woolworth lunch counter after buying school supplies also unlike school kids today who are mostly bussed to school we walked or rode bikes to school at school we had two recesses and gym class few times week i protested when recesses and gym class were eliminated as cost saving measures as children need to move my class growing up had very few chubby kids now obesity and even diabetes are plaguing our kids guaranteeing shorter and sicker lives for our children its time to take control again and saying no to junk food and yes to physically active lives
i'm glad i watched this video as someone who's struggled with being chubby kid all my life when i looked through your channel i got extremely bad vibes because i am someone activeley working on myself eating better exercising everything but when i saw your videos all i saw were clickbait titles and i got very uncomfortable i wasn't even aware of this fat positive movement i was only ever aware of bigger body positive movement which i am very much in support of and i'm glad you clarified obese because lot of people think overweight and obese are same thing and they very much aren't
i know this is 3 years late but if she made it in baby pink it will be fly silver is ugly
this video has really driven home just how selfish and manipulative self-created victims truly are tammy is basically my ex-mother - she was so vile that i disowned her decades ago but while i lived with her i saw many of traits tammy displays with my ex-mother i called it her martyr role - she was constantly complaining whining and inviting people to join her pity party she literally lived victim mentalityyet whenever anyone offered to help she say in very martyred voice - "oh no don't you worry about me i will do it myself"- and then in next breath complain again about how no one ever helps her it was manipulative to disgusting degree interspersed with her hate-filled rants against people her racism was also offensiveafter i disowned her - she and ex-father had done things that should have landed them in jail - whenever people asked about my family i say that i no longer had contact and sometimes i explained why there were people who judged me for disowning those toxic people i responded by kicking them out of my life - i wasn't going to tolerate anyone who expected me to go back to abusive people simply because "but they're faaamily" my siblings still kept in touch with their parents - and not only tolerated but enabled their toxic behaviours and that cost one married brother his marriage - his wife and kids got fed up with way he allowed his parents to treat them i knew from that alone that i had made right choice in kicking out two vile people out of my lifewatching these videos about infamous tammy has reminded me of extreme guilt tripping pathological lies gas lighting rewriting reality and shameless manipulation i endured from my ex-mother she was innately dishonest with herself and with others plays victim card like champion and still uses my spineless brother as her lackey because she refuses to change her ways and he is full-fledged enabler and doormati am grateful that i found right sort of counsellor decades ago who helped me recognise just how toxic these family members were and are and these days i don't feel shred of guilt or shame about having kicked those people out of my life it's about caring enough about my wellbeing to remove everyone and everything toxic out of my life so they can no longer damage me i now enjoy freedom and peace
i’m sorry but on some level i have to believe that these people are actually stupid like access to information nowadays is ridiculous you know what you’re doing you’re just lying to yourself and you’re dumb for getting on tv show and doing that i just don’t understand that how can you on one hand say i don’t eat sweets or anything like that i don’t have sugar but then on other hand slamming large cokes chocolate bars and everything else with your fast food meals

i hate to say this because freedom of speech and freedom of press were once critical in truth being known and to hold people accountable but we are heading towards our very freedoms being tools of evildoers to expedite our once great country's downfallour tolerance invites radicals who utilize our freedoms to work against us countries like china russia and iran use our freedoms against us via internet at some point we need strong leaders need to formulate plan to identify evil and put measures in place to disallow these groups from using our freedoms against us for good of our nation left and right will need to put in place safeguards not to allow one political party to silence other if we don't do something like this it's only matter of time before we collapse just as someone can't shout "fire" in crowded theater we need to ban and enforce bans against actions harming our country

wayy that jefree said "hoot" im dead'
best example that being obese isn't ok is sheer amount of people who watch videos like this (and be reading this) who previously bought into bopo slogans that keep you unhealthy and complacent then said "no more" and "never again"no amount of rallying "large and in charge" can persuade people that missing out on your life and your family is worth it

it’s not companies’ fault exclamation_symbol it’s kid(s) and parent’s fault companies can’t force you to eat their product you as parent choose what your kid can and can’t eat banning cartoons off fast food and junk food is bs that’s marketing… nothing wrong with that but it’s you parent(s) who makes decision if you will buy said product for your kid but when parent(s) gives said option to kid it’s now up to child to make best decision now said child will most likely choose as their parents thus meaning if parents set good examples child most likely pick out healthier options… and then splurge every now and then you be asking how do i know question_symbol cause this is how i am being raised i’m 16 and half now in high school and i make plenty of my own decisions almost all of which were influenced by my parents i know i have insane metabolism but i admit i do eat junk food it’s just i’m constantly burning those extra calories on average day i need as much as 2500 calories on weeks when i’m up at fire college with my explorer post doing training for up to 10 hours i easily eat 3000-3500 calories and plenty of water and electrolytes i know my body type how active i am and how fast process proteins carbohydratessugars fats and other nutrients that’s being said my parents guided me throughout life to make good solid choice when it comes to meal this is why i stand by claim “ parents and children are problem… not companies” change my mind…

it’s okay to be fat - it’s not okay to be unhealthy -
i was able to lose 60 lbs since august and i feel so much better i ate so horribly and so much i fed myself on fast food sugary drinks and candy so much candy i got up to 250lbsmy doctor put me on ketogenic diet (with lots of cruciferous vegetables and salads) while i also did intermittent fasting and i was able to lose all of that weight i was able to get off of heartburn medicine that i was on and i just feel overall so much healthier plus being able to fit into thinner clothes was added benefit as welli did get quite alot of help by using factor meal delivery service to order correct kind of food but it is way healthier than fast food and is about same if maybe cheaper than what i was spending on fast foodmy relationship with sugar and food in general has changed so much i am no longer being dictated by food and i have so much more time than waiting in lines for fast foodi like to transition to cooking from scratch all of food that i want to eat but my current work and living situation makes that difficult but in future i am going to work on that as welli also need to build more muscle and lose more fat

i also changed up my diet and eating habits in february this year i had been gaining and getting to fattest point in my life (relatively fat my bmi was just on lower end of overweight) i started intermittent fasting and doing strength resistance exercises 15 min day before breakfast lost 20lbs so far and it's steady now my clothes are getting looser still even though number on scale hasn't really changed smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes my pants size has gone from "not fitting into 32" to "easily fitting into 28" it's all about routine and perseverance no miracle cure for most people without certain medical problems like thyroid or whatever
it just blows my mind how so-called “professional” individuals were actually okay with threatened violence
i just can’t imagine living life in this condition i have certainly had my own issues with weight but never obesity as i’ve gotten older i have learned and accepted fact that i have to eat certain way and exercise certain amount to keep myself at healthy weight while i enjoy benefits of liking what i see in mirror reason i do it is to enjoy latter years of my life and have nice retirement it amazes me that these folks are still alive but i find these shows to be extremely exploitive amazing how low we’ve come to society to objectify these people who are obviously struggling with not only physical health but mental health issues

i absolutely love how you speak out about these issues yes some people really struggle with losing weight and being healthy due to food addiction etc which is really sad for people struggling with this but this “body positivity” cult is just so toxic and unhealthy people should be proud of themselves for being healthier even if they’re not able to be “skinny” not glorifying being unhealthy and making other people feel like if they tried to be healthy they be attacked and made to look like bad guys i’m glad people are starting to see through this because it’s sooooooo damaging and scary to think that people can be bullied into something like this by these so called “body positivity” influencers

hm i don't agree with many points here because "controlled" binge eating is having control most uncontrolled are like you said based on unhealthy diets when blood sugar drops so much that it's body's mechanism to make you crave for food espeially unhealthy things but thing you said with school is whole different topic for diet it's bad but for keeping your weight it's goodi did this most of my school time while having hashimoto (which means my metabolismn is so bad that i get weight fast and lose weight hard) but i had my rule first of all i never in my life eating breakfast if i have to wake up early i had rule that if i have 6 hours school i eat and drink nothing during that time if i have longer like 8 or 9 hours i will eat one apple and this i continued like 7 years ( question_symbol ) and - it was fine in evening i ate tons of trash huge portions dinner and snacks and sweets but it was planned and not randomly because it was like remaining in control during day no matter if your friends go and have break with nice food or you have opportunity to buy and in evening you reward yourself for it and i never gained any kg of weight during all years of course i didn't lose neither but also not gained weight so i disagree with that point that this behavior is just as bad as having no self control and just eat everything you see or get triggered by looking at other food like in media or such or get overrun by your body with blood sugar

everyone here is moron say it with me everybody women have always worked this fantasy of husband being provider and woman being pampered little stay at home mom has never been possible unless you were at top of food chainboth my grandmother's were traditional women guess what they worked more than their brothers and fathers because not only were they expected to do all of house work they were also expected to so just as much manual labor as their brothers and fathers at their farm and they also had no control over money they made through that labor because they were women neither of them had education either they both had to learn how to read by themselves and one of them who had to move to australia had to learn to speak english stop selling your weird fetish life style as feasable reality by using stupid women like that moron on video that's crying over being normal adult i've never acted that way because i remember stories my grandmother's told me all suffering they went through just because they didn't have right type of crotchand let's not fucking pretend that countries who still insist on living this way aren't countries where people live in most poverty also i watched documentary of young girls over there having to pretend to be boys because daddy dearest decided to abandon his wife and children because he couldn't father sons (the baby's sex is completely determined by father's biology after all and that's scientific fact) and responsibility to take care of everyone fell on shoulders of daughter who is still young enough to pass as boyfuck all of youi'll have to slave my life away anyway but at least now i can actually keep some of that money to myself and have some fucking independenceif you wanna live this way good for you you do you but get your hand away from my fucking rights

i found mayo clinic diabetes diet book by donald d hensrud in april of 2021 and this is best diet i have ever encountered it is not low carb diet and it is so easy to follow it recommends eating serving of fruit with every meal and having nonstarchy vegetables with meals it has you measure your protein carbs and fat (very low fat) with your meals and tells you how many to have each day based on how many calories day you want to eat i love this diet and have successfully lost weight and kept majority of weight off i was miserable trying to follow low carb diet in past and had no idea i be so happy following mayo clinic diabetes diet

i felt so sorry for teenage kitchen hand katie being treated like that by employer especially at that age can have devastating effect on your self confidence and when she applies for another job she will have to produce reference from that employer i've worked for people like that including in food industry (bakkavor who produce patries tarts and crumbles for sainsburys tesco waitrose) being shouted at and called stupid (i don't speak language from goa) and slut (because i am single and do not live with my parents - most of staff are 1st generation indian immigrants and although they are roman catholics they are really not westernised) all night long was really distressing i actually made nightmares (or daymares as i worked night shifts and so slept during day) about work on top of it i was on 0-hour contract so they litterally called me when they needed someone with never more than 10 hours' notice before start of my shift and sometimes less than 2 hours and about one third of my shifts were cancelled sometimes as little as half hour before i was due to start over 6 months period i earned less than half minimum salary and if i told them i was not available for shift (because i needed to go to laundromat) i was 'punished' by not being given any shifts for coming nights and once for 2 weeks on end eventually i insisted on using my holiday allowance in order to have eye test (can't really have one between 2 12-hour night shifts and as shifts were confirmed on day to day basis i not make any plans for daytime as i needed to sleep and answer phone in case they offered me shift) i was not given any shifts for 6 weeks then was told i was fired exclamation_symbol way they treat staff in food industry is disgusting and i will never buy pastries or tarts from waitrose sainsburys or tesco in future as if this were not enough plant was not very hygienic people were reluctant to wash their hands including after using toilets and if products fell on floor it sometimes be picked up and be put back up on production line anyone who is immuno depressed please make your own baked goods do not buy any from supermarkets

eh - not fan of diet coke back in day my only option was tab which to this day i miss although never to extent of liters day i actually prefer pepsi zero because it's sweeter some of coke zero flavors are palatable and others are downright disgusting (ergo y3k) if anything primary reason for addiction is caffeine of course i will drink diet or zero sugar coke if nothing else is available (has to be zero sugar due to t1d) although i'm just as likely to drink unsweetened iced tea which again is caffeine usually soda in cans is not as good as soda in bottles (for myself) and it matters where you get it amount of syrup being used and expiration (which yes there is one) if anything i consider myself addicted to carbonation as i can just as easily drink club soda biggest reason i prefer pepsi zero (or diet) is because it's seemingly more consistent with flavor some coke zero or diet was randomly just disgusting whether purchased at store or restaurant just personal experience though

i'm greek orthodox christian firstly i'll try to explain why orthodoxy is only truecorrect faith secondly i'll suggest some things that help anyone who is interested in orthodoxyfor first part orthodoxy is first original (historically) and only true faith which is outcome of direct revelation by god himself (the ιncarnated word of god = jesus christ - bible) and thus is not relegion (religion=a man-made belief system which is trying to explain god as all known religions (islamhinduism) or christian heresies (protestantism catholicism) are hence orthodoxy is not gesture of men reaching god but is gesture of god revealing himself to men) also is called "orthodoxy" which in greek (the language in which bible was written by apostles originally) means correct(ortho=ορθός=correct) belief(doxy=δοξασίαδόξα=belieffaithdogmatenet) and is faith of all greeks (to which jesus=god said(john 1220-24) " ²⁰some greeks had gone to jerusalem to worship during passover ²¹philip from bethsaida in galilee was there too so they went to him and said “sir we like to meet jesus” ²²philip told andrew then two of them went to jesus and told him²³jesus said time has come for son of man to be given his glory²⁴i tell you for certain that grain of wheat that falls on ground will never be more than one grain unless it dies but if it dies it will produce lots of wheat") prophesying that time has come for him (son of man = jesus as 100 percentage_symbol human as son of virgin marytheotokos) to die on cross (grain of wheatit dies) and then given his glory (jesus as 100 percentage_symbol god) after his resurrection and ascension to right hand of god also prophesying that his death "will produce lots of wheat" which is linked to greeks stating that greeks (and also all other people which are not jewish and follow same path (as greeks in that time symbolized all non jews) will glorify jesus by recognizing him as their messiah savior and true god and they will keep true and correct faith (orthodoxy) and they will not go astray (as heretics or other religions) and in this way they will participate in "production of lots of wheat" (in contrast to jews and other heretics (catholics etc which will do go astray and so they won't be able to inherit god's kingdom and be gods by grace)) (jesus was always before and after his death and always simultaneously 100 percentage_symbol human and 100 percentage_symbol god at first as 100 percentage_symbol god he took human nature by his gestation in virgin mary by holy spirit and became simultaneously 100 percentage_symbol human too then by his tortures and death of his human nature on cross he took upon himslef sin of entire fallen human nature and put end to it with death of this fallen nature of humans which didn't had ability of theosis (theosis=to become god not by nature but by grace) but was outcome of spiritual death and sin (see genesis in old testament and fall of adam and eve) finally with his resurrection and ascension (as 100 percentage_symbol human and 100 percentage_symbol god simultaneously) to right hand of god (the father and also with holy spirit to which he was fully connected to both of them always as second person of holy trinity by his 100 percentage_symbol god nature) he led human nature to ability of theosis and inheritance of god's kingdom making humans who manage to go to heaven same as him (by grace not by their nature)=gods by grace but there is big misconception in some heresies god didn't ιncarnated became human and died on cross to put everyone who says that believes in jesus in heaven instead he did all that to give to people ability of theosis and inheritance of god's kingdom whether this ability is reclaimed and person is saved and not go to hell depends on person's free will (and what they truly believe in their heart) which is expressed by their actions in their lives on earth acceptance of god's truth by becoming members of his one true church by being orthodox baptized (other heretic baptisms as catholic etc are invalid even if some orthodox priests who are in places where orthodoxy isn't very common say otherwise) and chrismated (also this two things are necessary in order to be able to commune with holy spirit and then jesus christ and actually see god himself and his uncreated light from this life on earth) and having correct lifestyle which includes gods commands and participation in liturgical mysteries and having spiritual father for guidance this belief that everyone will be saved just because they say they are christians is wrong it was made just because it's suits people as easy path and this is typical example of why all these diefferent heresies were created all known religions are either man-made paganistic phylosophies (hinduism) or heretic ideologies (protestantism catholicism islam) (influenced by revelation of god by god himself=orthodoxy---historically precedes all its heresies and islam too which is influenced by orthodoxy too anyway) where truth is changed falsified misquoted and manipulated in order to conform to sinful prejudices and to enforcement of authority of different people that made them (pope mohammed) belief that every belief is true and correct as long as someone refers to word jesus is wrong truth and gods' presence and grace is only in orthodoxy people don't know this things and continue to be misleaded from generation to generation also other proof is miracle of holy light at day of celebration of resurrection in easter which always is done by orthodox patriarch until today and one time in history (in 1549 ad) when heretics didn't let orthodox patriarch perform miracle and tried to do it by themselves miracle didn't happen and pillar next to orthodox patriarch opened and holy light came out illuminating only his candles emir watched events from minaret of mosque opposite temple and shouted "one is true god god of christians i believe in risen christ" then muslims caught him and beheaded him his holy relic is kept to this day in holy monastery of great virgin of jerusalem crack of pillar located in middle column to left of entrance to complex of holy sepulcher is 120 meters high and it looks like rising flame from then on heretics gave back to orthodox bishop right to do miracle himself biggest proof is that in all this religions people can not see god but in orthodoxy god can be seen directly experienced with all senses eaten and drunk uniting directly with baptized person's heart (by sacrament of holy eucharist) and personal existencial relationship and communication with god theosis and experience of heaven and gods kingdom can be achived by this life on earth as main element of orthodoxyfor second part some things that help are channel "trisagion films" which has videos about orthodoxy and lives of saints in english and movie of "the life of saint joseph hesychast" which is available in english in youtube byzantine music and hymns book "great gerontikon" and lives of saints elder ephraims of arizona monasteries throughout us (who is most probably to officially declared saint in recent future) holy mountain of athos and vatopedi monastery and its youtube channel pray to god by your own words or with known orthodox prayers as much as you can in order to start feeling grace inside your heart learn about "unceasing prayer of mind and heart" ("jesus prayer")and most importantly find spiritual father for guidance start having correct lifestyle which includes gods commands and learn as much as you can by studying participate in liturgical mysteries of church when you feel ready be orthodox baptized (other heretic baptisms as catholic etc are invalid even if some wrongly say opposite) and chrismated (2 things necessary to be able to commune with god and see god himself and his uncreated light from this life on earth and achieve theosis and for later to be able to inherit god's kingdom) only purpose of all those things is to help person achive complete communion (personal existencial relationship that happens with all our being-body and soul) with god theosis (as outcome of former) and experience and inheritance of heaven and gods kingdom (=god's presence) first from this life and then for eternity in other life by sacrificing only thing that we havecan produce by our selves which is our free will (as god given abilityevery other thing either comes from grace of godhis presence or absence of grace of godhis absence) (free will = ability to accept or reject presence of god in uswe are like mechanical machine we can do certain things (that are similar to things god himself doesif good as we are images of god--and this only because god created us that way) but only if we have necessary fuel in us which in this case is grace of god (if we are speaking about good things) or absence of grace of god (if we are speaking about bad thingsthere is no empty space in spiritual word but "empty space" of absence of god is "filled" with opposite traits of god which are evil things) every good thing is ray of light of god's infinite uncreated light and every bad thing is absence of ray of light of god's infinite uncreated light

21 pounds in 21 days is possible with low enough intake over that time half of that weight is water and glycogen and will go straight back on after 21 days but you can get reading on scale that low for man fasted weight loss is around 06 lbsday so 126 lbs and can lose around 8 pounds of water if you go from fully fed to this kind of restriction as you use up your glycogen stores and your cells dump sodium both of which cause you to shed water plus pound for glycogen itself it’s not good plan and “science” is bunk but that claim itself is plausible if very misleading with starvation diet

i’ve always struggled with weight fluctuations and it’s always been in unhealthy way 10 years ago i lost lot of weight because i had to be healthy due to being pregnant but after i had my child i didn’t keep it off and went back to bad habits again fast forward to now and i have greater understanding on how to be healthier i’ve lost about 5kg (11lb) give or take in last month and i feel like i’m absolutely on right track i’m lot happier and am proud of myself for gaining strength to do this what annoys me is that when i was at my heaviest people tell me i looked fine and that i’m not fat etc when i clearly was lol

i've recently tried skipping out on breakfast and lunch and just eating big meal at end of day semi keto semi carnivore but i do allow for some sweets i gave tried calorie tracking before and meal prepping but having to have lunches packed and ready everyday takes lot of effort it's easier for me to buy some steak and eggs or salmon freeze it let it thaw then come home after working and have nice big meal it's more convenient for me than planning out entire weeks worth of meals and making sure i bring something to lunch because when i miss day i still feel like i need to eat at work so i'll grab lunch or get snack and it'll cause me to fall off wagon yes this message is scattered last year i started watching your videos and felt inspired to lose weight i tracked calories diligently for about 4 months and lost about 40lbsbut demands of my job caught up i was working lot of double and mg sleep was suffering i didn't have time to prep meals i was stressed and decided to just give up and started eating out again id stopped going in mg afternoon walks i stopped trying i gained everything back and that makes it so much harder to want to try again because i know just how long it will take to get back to where i was i think secret be to not just stick to one approach calorie counting or intermittent fasting or particular diet but to be adaptive to change right now 1 meal day strategy seems to be working but i feel like i need to be flexible thanks for reading if indeed you did and i love your channel

was trying to wait until end to comment but when you got to doctor calling megan ( question_symbol ) biggest failure i had to stop and cry i'm obese and in 2005 nearly lost both legs in car wreck my recovery was hard - about year of constant physical therapy break more surgery more pt rinse and repeat one day i had pt shortly after visit with doctor and i was so depressed i started telling my pt that doctor had said "if you ever walk with just walker or crutches i'll consider you success" in context of conversation he made it clear that he didn't expect me to even achieve that much i'm crying telling my pt this while we work and he starts laughing at me i was like what question_symbol exclamation_symbol question_symbol exclamation_symbol question_symbol exclamation_symbol pt said "what are you doing right now question_symbol " i was going up and down staircase using handrail and cane that a$$hole doctor's words were so strong that i couldn't even see that i had outdone his expectations if i hadn't had such great relationship with my pt if he hadn't been just most awesome person ever i probably have given up that day later on i had another doctor mock my asthma attack and tell me i should just kill myself and that conversation was not as harmful as first onepeople don't like mirrors put together 2 people who you think are exactly alike and they will dislike each other because all they see in other is their own faults and weaknesses two besties that were going through same thing and one changes their life that's convicting - other is immediately faced with "i should be able to do that too" and hasn't weight loss journeys are like kids people want baby (being smallerhealthier) but they don't want diaper changes sleepless nights etc(the work to get there) they accept all kinds of excuses as to why they can't make change and when someone they know does it it puts lie to their excusewe have to learn to succeed that we can be success many of us have so much experience being failures that we really don't have any expectation of success even with littlest tasks we have to train ourselves to remember that we can accomplish stuff and to expect that we will succeed we tend to set unreasonable non-specific goals with no plan how to reach them - like vague "get healthy" resolution - because we don't actually know how to get there and don't expect to recently saw short where dude said one reason we self-sabotage is so we are mentally prepared for consequences and can control our hurt he was talking about relationships but i think it applies to all harmful behavior if i say "i'm going to get skinny" there's not one person - including me - who can believe that so no one is disappointed when i fail however if i just make one choice at time teaching myself that i can change and do better little at time i train myself to believe what i say i will do and each act becomes affirmation of what i can achieve it took nearly year of going to gym weightlifting and walking 3 days week adding in some exercise classes 2 days week tracking my food and making better choices for me to actually believe i will succeed at losing weight and getting healthier

i disagree with lot of your opinions but i watch you because i think it’s important to watch people you disagree with because it makes you question things which is important since watching your videos it’s made me realize that i don’t need to feel bad for losing weight it’s my body and i’m allowed to do what i want with it since then i’ve lost 20 pounds and i’ve started doing pilates every morning which has actually helped alot with my mental illnesses weight loss has also helped alot with my confidence i wish i could’ve been confident at my bigger size but unfortunately i can change my opinions but i can’t change world and being able to shop at more stores has had impact as well on my well-being i really became indoctrinated by body positivity and i think there definitely needs to be more healthy medium no one should feel bad for losing weight if it’s done in healthy manner that makes you feel better

most people can just become more attractive it's harder when your trans as woman that was not even allowed hormones testosterone ruined my body forever and it makes it impossible to look like what you should look like it's harder to find jobs its much harder to find partners etc its ridiculous for us even worse than normal cis people but that said humans lived in tribes most people in many years ago all had good faces modern day has changed our habits how we move how we chew how we sit lot and it makes our faces look weird and abnormal in past you'd know everybody and it reduces self esteem issues plus most people all looked good

when i lost lot of weight some people in my family were little worried i was going overboard they never expressed worry about other people smaller than me so i just think it's because they were used to something and seeing dramatic change makes them aware of something going on maybe they were worried i continue to loose lot of weight even when i became thinregular size especially since it happened quickly it have seemed like it was done in unhealthy way and had become obsession also when person looks lot different from last time you saw them it's like meeting new person meaning they have "killed part of person you knew and loved"but then we also have fat people feeling betrayed as well because they want others to have same problem they have that they can look up to or point to whenever they want excuse for how they live

i don't think i can tell someone how to lose weight since i've never had these problems but if i was to give advice it be to reduce amount of unhealthy habits and intentionaly create good habits like for example last year i realised that after finishing university andstarting work i was getting in worse shape over time when that happened i didn't go to gym instead i started jogging like 1-2 km day did like 10 push ups and that was it i also started intentionally avoiding any unhealthy food reasonably though i try to eat mostly home made meals or something in fancy restaurants that it whole food nothing artificially processed other than that i eat aa much as i feel like and have greatly incresed amount of exercises now i feel much better it's going back to 16-18 year old body when i was sorta athletic (nothing special though but do about 25-30 pull ups for example) i think it is good way to improve your health in long run just avoid extreams

i have in my possession two books one called commonsense cookery book reprinted in 1962 but it is older than that it has lot of recipes about brain and other parts of animal that we don't eat in many recipes and another book called colonial cook book most of recipes are from news clippings and book was first published in 1864 there is so much use of every part of animal and so much fat lard and other animal products that you cook with used my grandmother also used to cook when my mum was young most of these foods oxtails brains lots of liver everything was cooked in some kind of fat one thing when i was child that she did do is lard was always kept and reused until it was unusable she never cooked any of these recipes when i was kid maybe if i had known i have asked her too family were in middle class and my nana was stay at home mother to four there was also historical study that found now i'm probably going to quote it wrong but it was 100 or more soup recipes that women in middle ages had to learn in england before they got married each one had for different health benefits or ways to help their husbands there is also fishmonger in melbourne who sells fish and then shop right next door that he owns he uses every part of fish to make food for people and it is getting quite popular

food industry has nothing to do with children being obese healthy food options are out there obese children are direct result of lazy parents period
i dont want to sound like im thinking that im "healthy example" because im not (bmi 16 not anorexic or anything) but i never understood "binge eating" like why question_symbol also i love making my own food if there is way for me to make it from scratch i will do it (for example my own pasta or my own burger buns or just anything i like knowing what i eat (maybe im just autistic because i also like knowing what medicine i take i really dont like taking some pills without knowing what is main substance in them and how it affects my body)) think that i believe is most unhealth thing in my diet is that i dont have schedule for eating i just eat when i feel hungry sometimes (most often when im spending whole day in front of pc (programmer)) i can get by on single sandwich per day other times i can eat 4 course meal and still feel hungry my favorite meals are toasts avocado toast toasts with "skagenröra" (swedish prawn salad) or just toast with some type of cold meat and tomato with mozzarella and bit of olive oil like i said i dont want say that im "healthy example" because im not but i believe that im more healthy than most americans (sorry dont feel ofended i know you probably will) but i dont think that bmi is very good measurement for "healty" just like i dont believe that iq is good measurement for "intelligence" but whole my life i was on skinny side (guy 185cm and around 55-60kg i never in my life were above 65kg never had health problems caused by my diet i dont go ty gym but i have active lifestyle 15000 steps per day is little for me love biking) @kianadocherty what is your opinion about my lifestyle question_symbol edit today im 20 years old 185cm and 62kg bmi of 181 (0 percentage_symbol underweight)
so i was doing strength camps around that time i weighed in just under 180lbs at 5'11" had 33" waist and af clothes did not fit me right my shoulders were too broad and both my quads and calves were literally too big to get their pants on it was absurd basically if you were guy and were not legit skinny with muscles or just skinny their clothes were not going to fit you and by "skinny" i don't mean 13 percentage_symbol -15 percentage_symbol bf i mean sub 10 percentage_symbol body fat if you had any type of athletic build i'd occasionally see regularly built guys with decent size muscles with button downs and t-shirts that were skin tight i wondered why i never saw any of them with shirts buttoned when i tried some on i found out it's because they not button themas for girls section yeah again you needed to be crazy thin to fit into their clothes and regular size hips on size 5 was probably going to put you in size 10 as clothes ran so small across board it was ludicrous i liked style of clothes quite bit but tailors who designed them definitely made their audience far smaller than it should have been i mean c'mon i wore 32" waist jeanscargos in half of brands i wore at time 33" in others and i not fit into their pants or shorts correctly question_symbol stupid heh i was big "dawson's creek" fan though that final episode oh those folks at cw got me tearing up when i saw jen talking to grams then ending with joey pacey and dawson sniffle great here i go again

you explained concept of intuitive eating quite precisely ) and although you speak quite critically about haes in one of your videos you just pointed out some of main principles around haes food advice ) eat when you're hungry stop when you're full include feel-good movement eat fibre enjoy your meal with all senses what certain instagram culture made of this inclusive movement and its good intention well i share your criticism at some point by way these principles equal principles of intuitive eating (such facts combined with audios for subconscious changes) 1 eat when you're hungry 2 eat what makes you feel happy and healthy 3 enjoy your meal and trust your hunger signals 4 stop when you feel adequalely satiated started both haes theory and intuitive eating practice to get back in line with my body and to make peace with it most ironically lost weight with it now i'm combining both aspects and write about haes and body-related topics in my blog among other topics ) another fun fact at this point in earlier times social pressure and negative feelings led to emotional eating (my intuitive eating programme steps into subconscious part of emotional eating) and since i have been practising this idea (theoretically it was known to me through haes) same negative emotions result in total lack of appetite so i must force myself to eat then sorry long post - but be helpful for you )
yeah ive been overweight my entire life (same with like majority of my family) and i never have watched this because i have major issues with depictions of addictions and eating disorders (plus that opening scene where mc jerks off and has heart attack wasnt exactly my cup of tea) so im glad this vid talks about it cause this actually made it way more accessible exclamation_symbol also if you want to reaserch "big food" and how food companies exploit people you should throw some reserch into health accessibility in food which is basically how healthy foodmeals can't be consistently prepared by working-class peoplefamilys while food thats almost by design going to make people fat is cheep and usually pre-made which results in health and weight loss being inaccessible for certain classes (which leaves diet companys open to sell them "cheap pre-made diet supplements exclamation_symbol " that usually aren't even healthy or don't actually work cough slimfast cough) sorry this turned into rant but idk felt fitting lol great video exclamation_symbol

i liked fat families because it made light of weight loss journey i feel there is too much sad emotions around weight loss and while its serious issue seriousness itself can make weight loss seem like its more difficult task than it needs to be bluntness helps to de-personalize fatness for me and allowed me to poke fun at myself instead of feeling crushing shame this strategy not work for everyone but it really did help me make weightless seem more achievable that and i'd rather work off my wobbly-bum than my fat a$$ lol edit forgot to add this was first show that treats entire family as group instead of just trying to coach one person who is surrounded by enablers
"that's kinda what we are designed for" excuse me question_symbol what exactly is it you want to imply here this woman is working at home on her podcast promoting women's safety talking about for left and how women's rights are being taken away are you forgetting that back before electricity was invented everything was made by hand women were working they just did it by pretty much making everything family needed that husband never do in his entire life plus nurses female nurses that were closest things to female doctors also existed it is something that has always existed mid wife's don't forget hand maids female slaves seamstresses and female politicians in royalty not to mention elders and nuns any other kind of work that women were able to get it all depended mostly on their education and class pretty much you can't afford education if you have to pay for it and you are poor no one stops to think about that do they question_symbol be grateful for you got today ladies if you do not then history is doomed to repeat

tammy has done nothing but gain weight over course of show and it showed through her sheer laziness narcissism and absolute lack of self awareness shit her body has literally gone to final resort of storing excess fat in her forehead of all places amy on other hand along with her and tammy's brother put everything aside to go through with their journeys and complete them and they took full responsibility when thr screwed up
i agree you can do what you want with your body as long as you do not harm or kill someone else i can choose to swing my arm around but if assault someone with it it is wrong very act of abortion is to harm and kill someone else another body abortion allows someone to refuse responsibility for their choices

only problem with your stupid bs argument ben is that your basis for it is based in some made up bullshit about floaty dude in sky that lives in castle of gold and if you worship him enough you will go there when you die you supporting abolishment of all forms of abortion means that women who are going to have fatal delivery or child that will be born into pain and disability and never have life worth living all those options to abort dangerous pregnancies will go with it you are fkn idiot to say that there is no legitimacy in any abortion

i have feeling that big food is behind push for fat acceptance and "600lb set-point" stances i think if we follow those threads back to their origins we'd end up in corporate boardroom in mix of pr brainstorming session on how to change narrative around fact that their incredibly cheap nutrient void highly addicting chemical concoctions they gleefully label as food is causing obesity crisis
not eating meat on fridays was because…the fishing industry needed boost that had nothing to do with god
my take is "fat positivity" is just extremist group that has given up on improving themselves it is dedication and work to be healthy but they are so incredibly insecure that they have to convince others that are also overweight that living this unhealthy life is more beneficial so they don't have to actually have to try work at anything if they put as much energy in trying to convince people to stay on this path of self-destruction imagine what they do if they actually tried to lose weight
as obese person who has lost weight multiple times i have lot to say ex fat people are harshest group of people toward fat people i know this from first hand experience both from 1 being victim of ex fat person fatphobia and 2 going through that same psychological process that makes ex fat people feel that way when they lose weight i dont think being fat gives anyone out of being fatphobic its ingrained in our society just like racism also most people are not saying that being fat is due to genetics and socio-economic upbringings instead of choices we are to point in our development as society where we can see and acknowlege that genetics environment and socio economic status have huge inputs on persons abilities to make decisions its not one or otheryoure strong reaction to these groups of people is what gives off vibe that you hate fat people i see it clearly bc ive been there most people who look to "fat activists" are just normal people seeking sympathy in world that gives them nothing but "tough love" and "pull yourself up from boot straps" energy you know what that feels like and you used that energy to transform your life which is fantastic and i'm really happy for you but not everyone is you not everyone thrives with that type of pressure there's countless conversations that have been had about this at end of all this i just want to say im not mad at you i've been you its very easy to defend position youre taking its more work to accept fat people as fellow human beings who deserve compassion but i promise its worth iti still struggle with internalized fatphobia but where i am now is much happier place where i can give all versions of myself compassion and understanding thats truly life changing

god is not human being he does not punish he does not kill he does not hate he does not seek revenge he does not make anyone suffer he does not allow anything near hell to exist or demonic devil of evil to exist god loves and his actions follow suit in that heshe is not like us when we are out of spirit and let’s face it most of us are out of spirit in our actions most of time bible is wrong on many counts and accounts yet at times it is correct it cannot be last word on god and spirituality it was made by well meaning people (most of them) to keep order in confusing murderous world of people gone wild and it worked…until it was then used to create more strife more rivals groups and more division
honestly think they did her more harm than good only thing that benefited her change was exposure and accountability them purposely sneak feeding her ham was horrible i'm glad you brought attention to many of other factors that explain person's food "addiction" but you didn't discuss way those foods act on her brain carbs give us rush fats make it last longer so even eating this few times week make you crave it so you feel that good again she has years of memories of this food combo being safe delicious and making her feel good - that is something that will take long time of continuous effort to counteract

as russian citizen who lived most of my life in moscow and actively opposed putin i can say that putin's actions aren't as calculated and strategic as it seemhe is senile dictator not much different from african warlords really big difference is that he has much more organized corruption group who runs whole country and steals from nation on scale that's really difficult to immagine he controlls media in russia and covers his people who steal from any government controlled industry in country his invasion of ukraine is gross miscalculation - he underestimated people of ukraine his intel told him that ukranians welcome russian army and will actually greet them with flowers instead his troops encountered people who die rather than surrender their lands and homes- he overestimated his troops decades of corruption and stealing left his army poorly equiped badly trained and ill-motivated - his plan relied on taking kiev in three days (that was officially said by lot of russian media when war started) and changing government there now that he failed he improvises but his reign left him country that's easy to rule but hard to make efficient production international affairs mobilisation and even propaganda - all of that is crumblingthis doesn't mean that he isn't dangerous or that people of russia have any realistic chance of dethroning him any time soon but that means that he is heading towards his inevitable defeat we can only hope that this madman won't resort to nuclear weapons to go down with bang

it’s great that you have had 303 so much success as much you motivate and encourage others to succeed on their journeys to health that is great thing i believe that obesity is unhealthy research does show that there is strong genetic component to obesity there are also significant socioeconomic indicators of health that underlie obesity my knowledge of obesity is that it is result of complex combination of factors it’s not just matter of personal willpower or inner strength in fact my view of many obese people is that they have tried multiple times to lose weight and that it takes tremendous courage to keep trying even if failure seems likely i respect them for that and never demean anyone for failure yes obesity can be overcome it’s not impossible but this will never occur as result ofany kind of denigrationagain since your videos inspire others in positive manner i applaud you

this girl helped me lose 40lbs during her first season of weight loss videos and i genuinely believed i was being healthy and developing healthy relationship with food but then out of nowhere after i found your videos i realised i wasn't being healthy and i was just hating myself and punishing myself for something that i didn't need to be punished for i still struggle with food cravings and my weight now but i want to be more proactive with my eating and figure out what's best for me i've started going to gym so i can build up stamina and muscle whilst trying my hardest to ignore scale (i have to keep telling myself muscle weighs more than fat) and i can already feel my legs toning up and muscles in my arms building up i still struggle with my body image and still see myself as some fat overweight blob but i'm hopefully getting somewhere and hopefully soon i can work on changing that

for me eyeopening moment that made me realize i needed to eat healthier and loose weight was in 2020 after 6month furlough due to pandemic i have always been lucky that i was skinny teen despite eating whatever i wanted people thought i was undereating until they actually saw me eat grinning_face_with_sweat so between 16 and 25 i ate whatever i wanted without gaining ounce i stayed same weight throughout give or take 1kg and not really developing healthy eating habits grinning_face_with_sweatwhen i came back to work from my furlough last year my work uniform was too small and i had to ask my boss for bigger size (embarassing) this prompted me to ask myself did i really gain so much weight lately question_symbol thinking_face and for first time in 10 years i stepped on scale bit of shock to see i had actually gained over 20kg in last 10 years i suddenly very clearly saw myself turning into my mom my mom is most wonderful kind and generous person in world and i love her so much but she is quite overweight i see her struggle now in her 60’s when we go shopping she needs breather breaks and small distances for her seem many miles painful on her joints and too exhausting i can see health problems her weight is causing and i realized i do not want to turn into my mom i want to be able to walk without pain or exhaustion when i am in my 60’s i want to travel without fitting too tight in seats on transportation i want to be more fit and healthy than my mom is now when i reach that age i realized my streak of eating whatever i wanted was over and that i needed to eat less more healthy and start exercising if i didn’t i just gain another 20kg next 10 years and then i really notice health problems so for me loosing weight now means staying fit and active and capable of doing whatever i want in future and in my old age i want to be active world travelling granny exclamation_symbol smiling_face not sure if that vision is clear enough but for me not becoming my mom is great motivator woman_shrugging i lost 5kg in past 6months so i am taking it slow and steady so i can keep this new healthier eating patern for many years to come
1205 to say it's not at all about willpower but rather strategy or something else isn't true you're normally rational but as is commonly case when people get blinded by commercialism (eg selling product in this case your program) their objectivity and respect for truth become compromised plus their wording becomes less precise and filled with absolutespeople can easily control elephant for example stop eating m@sturbating (nofap) etc using willpower alone for example i was addicted to sugar especially soda but started having reactive hypoglycemia it was manageable and i wasn't yet diabetic but i gave it up without issue for years i even store it cold in my fridge for my family and never drink it despite it being visible cool and easily accessiblei'm not bragging i'm simply pointing out that almost everyone is capable of immediately and permanently ending lifelong addiction cold turkey using willpower alone even if stakes aren't all that high (eg annoying but manageable episodes of reactive hypoglycemia) not reaching for junk food having binges and so on can easily be done by anyone by no stretch of imagination is this comparable to trying to fight far stronger animal like elephant that's gross exaggeration and perfect example of defeatism blame game etc

i just don’t get whole “ don’t be so hard on yourself let go of perfectionism and don’t linger on numbers” “don’t be so strict and cut out entire foods” but then it’s “ you have to be in caloric deficit or else you won’t lose weight” “white processed foods are your worst enemy” it’s so mentally exhausting i lost weight 6 years ago and gained double it i lost 40 lbs last year and i still enjoyed foods i loved but managed to regain 30 of those lbs in last few months i’m so lost and helpless i don’t know
most people in us are fat because they still think 2000 calorie per day recommended diet still applies to modern timesit was created back when average person got tenth amount of calories from sugar and were far more active than people today even if they stick to 2000 calories (which i highly doubt) they wonder why they don't lose weight from exercise not understand recommendation already includes moderate exercise i also think lot of fat people will go eat out to place like applebee's and then think that what they're served is normal portion of food to eat 2 or 3 times day typically restaurant meal is enough calories to last entire day and then some

people confuse traits of narcissist way too often with traits of bpd or with plain old overcorrection of extremely low confidenceshe hates herself when she says she’s great and all all she’s doing is trying to convince herself you can tell she doesn’t like herself at all in fact she dislikes herself so much that she’s already confident beforehand that she’ll fail at losing weight

i get why adults try to encourage children to try new foods it is good for them to do so but i will never understand why they attempt to force feed foods that are already known to make child gag all it does is create bad memory in best possible scenario or aversion and maybe even phobia in worst case my mom did same thing with me and fish (in my case orange roughy not even deliciously cooked but steamed with no seasoning other than little margarine i was made to sit at table for hours choking it down as if it was punishment i even remember my mom seeming mad at me which makes no sense to me as adult i'm 34 now and only over last five years or so have i worked up courage to try new seafoods that are actually well prepared i even love sushi now but for years i was afraid to try it thinking i gag
i feel like it's hard to get nuance into discussion about health 200 years after fact there's difference between quantity and quality of life and just because people were living to old age doesn't mean they were living to old age and being healthy elderly i'd be interested to see rates of cvd and cva in people who grew up in that golden period with so much consumption of saturated fat others have said in comments section here article doesn't discuss things like chronic disease- and they're right too it's all good and well having robust immune system that can fight off infection but living under cloud of smog and sweeping chimneys from age of 5 is probably going to do number on your lungs and will put you at risk of conditions like copd and heart disease i think another thing people often do gloss over is chronic disease is not one-and-done- problems like copd heart disease and chronic kidney disease etc can all be problems that take years to progress and manifest themselves as well you have to wait some time to see if someone's intersection of environment and genetics will cause them to to develop cvd as example
suger doesnt cause weight gain directly fat does dairy like cheese milk etc are superfoods designed to make babies gain weight when you eat suger as well you use sugers 1st then other stuff like dairy get stored as fat too much suger while over weight means not all suger is being used and that causes type 2 diabetes reducing suger is good idea but stopping dairy is far more effective also dont eat on schedule only eat when your actually hungry most people have no idea what actual hunger is though

i know this video is old but as former ballet dancer and knowledgeable in subject i want to point out few things - you can start ballet since you are very young but you cannot start pointe until you are older and your feet legs and body are ready - overweight kids can do ballet but as they grow if they want to become professionals they should be thinner for several reasons main one being partnering ballet performances have constant lifts where male needs to be able to lift you and do all kinds of movements that be very difficult if female is overweight as for pointe overweight girl can do pointe but if she wants to become professional she should lose weight - ballet is hardcore it is very hard and it requires extreme commitment it is amazing exercise but weight is about eating habits if you don't eat right and are overweight because of it you lose couple of pounds with ballet but you will still be overweight with muscles you need to eat right - there are so many other elements required to become professional ballet dancer such as shape of your legs and feet etc that i won't discuss them here my sister is former principal dancer and lead ballet dancer of our country she currently owns school and trains dancers she went through lot growing up because because of weight restrictions in ballet they give her fine for every pound she was overweight she went through eating disorders because of it she wasn't even overweight she just has very muscular legs which required her to loose even more weight now she does everything in her power not discourage or traumatize young girls that want to dance she allows all kinds of people to dance in her school if they want however if girl is serious about becoming professional my sister talks to them privately about things that girl couldshould do and encourages and guides them to get better physically (including weight) and become better dancers
many of problems humans have are because society have developed faster than human brain human brain looks for food it used to be hard to get food therefore no overeating nowadays we have abundance of food at our fingertips all time so human brain thinks "must eat and store fat for time there's lack of food" our brains haven't developed fast enough

therapy is best way to help with weight loss when it comes to adults and children at least when weight comes from something like eating disorder or lack of motivation obesity disorder is usually snake that eats itself it’s cycle that keeps getting compacted as everyone calls them disgusting things it can’t be fixed in 4-12 week camp that’s why they do these disgusting “quick fixes” for children they show immediate short term results but many will never reach their long term goals because none of these kids are really getting their true problems addressed

i totally get identity thing and that it has become new religion but people have 'vegan' in their bio not because it's their diet or just how they eat it's because it's whole movement and philosophy and ethic of not causing harm which people are activists for because it wasn't norm in society and due to that activism it is now becoming normalisedwhat vegans understand is that food choices aren't just affecting us they are affecting planet and other non human animals who have to suffer due to our dietary choices which is why it actually is big deal and something to be proud about not just because they think it's healthier diet or because they will lose weight

"there's only two kinds of guys who wear hawaiian shirts gay guys and big fat party animals" --homer simpson
to say "i never eat sugar" only shows how malinformed you really are about what you are actually eating since dextrose glucose and fructose are contained in just about everything you eat especially supermarket stuff all has "added" sugars in multiple forms properly educate yourself about what you put into your mouth first and then start questioning whether you're fat and perhaps discovering why then next big step is to get over self-denial and self-pity and do something about what makes you unhappy 3

i'm gonna be real with y'all losing weight is challenging it took me 2 years to finally beat obesity and most of weight loss only started happening after few months there were many nights of feeling miserable for having craving i dreaded exercise but slowly learned to love activity in my own way worst part was looking in mirror and wondering if anything i was doing was actually going to work progress was slow but necessary it didn't help me feel less ashamed in clothes or that i couldn't eat certain foods oddly enough i made far more progress after learning to love myself unconditionally no matter what state my body was in learning to appreciate food from holistic sense really helped clothes part can still be challenge today even when people say i look good but that's okay i'll work on that

i know this fly in face of video but - do they have "skinny camp" i'm not kidding my whole life i've been underweight my parents are scared for me i used to try justify it as "oh but at least i'm not fat"but now i wonder if it be just as bad as being fat (not obese though i'm well aware obesity is still worse) but lock of iron and protein in my body had my doctors concerned especially my neurologist because she warned my low iron in my blood actually reduce effectiveness of my seizure medicationrecently i have had protein increase (and not via expensive protein shake) butnow i'm reading how all these oils in peanut butter ain't so good i work from home so this past year finally started cooked frozen food (but oven food not microwave) so i have to watch my salt butno issues yet bah exclamation_symbol thing is i won't listen to nutritionist exclamation_symbol (i will listen to my neurologist above vitamin d and calcium pills though because i refuse stop skiing and don't plan on losing my bones any time soon)edit it is not my family's fault they always offer up whatever fresh meal they made and recently i've actually started joining them since i work 3rd shift at home

on topic of food ordering apps- i’m on other end of spectrum anorexia bingepurge subtype i developed huge shame in people seeing me in relation to food and i hated purging in public restrooms i dont have car either so picking up food from my favorite binge spots in near impossible where i live so i turned to food delivery apps they made me spiral to crazy levels i was binging and purging multiple times everyday i was spending absurd amounts of money on food and delivery and because of this i was investing even less food than normal as my time was taken up binging and purging so i lost even more weight it was dark time in my life i swore off food delivery if i want to binge and purge i have to go get it and that has dramatically decreased frequency my general consensus- food delivery apps are bad for everyone it should not be so easy to get food

i remember going to music festival few years ago in rimini near bologna italy i loved beaches but i know lot of italian's say beaches there suck rolling_on_the_floor_laughingthere were no mcdonald's or fast food places within several miles nearly everyone was in great shape it completely put me to shame i saw like 2 overweight people (1 of them sadly being myself) there over 3-4 days i visited i couldn't believe it everyone was either lean or near jacked then came back to my home city in north of uk and it was business as usual about 50 percentage_symbol of people obese
omg yesss exclamation_symbol i grew up thinking that only way to be pretty was to be skinny white and have blonde straight hair even movies like princess diaries (which is still one of my favorite movies) sent me on rampage when i watched it about year ago as adult makeover scene basically tells young women that if you wear glasses and have curly hair then you're not considered to be 'attractive' like damn no wonder i was so insecure about my appearance growing up

i have loved you before but i often thought that you don't look all that happy i don't know i felt like all makeup and people and pr and amount of work you were desperately trying to fill up hole and you cared so much about what others thought even people who absolutely weren't worth itnow when i watch you i sense that you're having fun and that makes watching your videos much more chill and i'm so glad to see you grow and live your life for you and for others but still share it with ussomehow when you share real you with us it feels so much more precious than when you were putting up show it was great too but one really see built up stress right under surface

i was born in slovenia it’s ex yugoslavian country thats been independent since 1991 and fully joined eu in 2003 we were part of socialist regime before and very fast adopted western capitalism on paper everything was state owned before but in practice workers were real owners of every factory of every business salary gap between ceo of company and cleaner in company were not as crazy as todayone example is (and i’m talking this from my own experiences from being kid and teenager growing up in that regime)my father was electrician for big curtain factory and my mother was sales person in grocery store at end of year when business made more money then expected both of my parents received part of that money and every summer we went on one month vacation in croatia where accommodation was 100 percentage_symbol payed by company these summer houses were owned by governmentworkers so they got to use them my childhood memories were beautiful with my parents not being overworked as they became after these vacations were modest no 5 starts hotels and so its croatian places that are now being rented for 200€ per nightsomething that now 90 percentage_symbol of slovenian croatian families simply can never affordwith slovenia becoming independent and my parents being very motivated to create something of their own they started their own business in 90s with money that was quite easy to save during socialistic times they started with opening one “car parts store” and eventually added 4 more over years we were financially doing very well i guess you say we were rich my parents were extremely hard working and smart with money they build their own house out if city and even bought 2 big apartments that supposed to be for me and my brother so looking from outside everything was great but quality of life went extremely downhill my parents were overworked those one month vacations were gone simply because there was no time for that if we squeeze 6 days per year it was already lotwith parents being overworked health problems occurred (thankfully we didn’t adopted western healthcare practices even now going to doctor is practically for free)my parents were stressed working 6 days per week my 7 years younger brother had luxury of getting lot of material things and opportunities that i hasn’t ( he started lot of hobbies that he never followed trough) but he missed on having happy parents that had time for him like for instance i had even though he had much more things i definitely consider myself as lucky one fast forward to today due to globalisation and foreign corporations majoring of slovenian businesses went bankrupt or were simply bought up by businesses from richer countries small country with less than 2 million of population on border of europe union simply cannot compete with richer bigger more established countries of eu one of biggest problems national problems based in my opinion is housing crisis prices are same as for instance in germany where i live now for 6 yearsexcept that average salary is 800€ net while in germany is 2300€ net even with very poor calculation skills you can determine that anyone owning and paying of apartment in their lifetime in slovenia is practically impossible this is my explanation of socialism based on experiences i collected while growing up in very interested era conversion from socialism to what i call “the disease that will end humanity - mother and father of evil - capitalism”

if you haven't eaten for 6 hoursyou're not "starving" you're just plain old hungry that's it starving is when your body fat percentage drops so low that your body begins to snack on your muscle and organ tissue it's pretty much guarantee that anyone who is dieting will never be "starving" if they weigh more than number of marine corps heightweight chart we need to stop using language like "starving" and people who are fat need to get comfortable with feeling hungry people need to have enough self discipline that they overpower their ghrelin they need to be able to say to it "who's in charge here question_symbol meor you question_symbol " and then take charge and do what needs to be done abstain from eating until chosen time

when i was in marine corps there were different pft (physical fitness test) standards for men and women three basic aspects of pft were run (men 3 miles in 18 minutes women 15 miles) sit-ups (men 80 in two minutes women 40) upper body strength (men 20 pull-ups women hang onto bar) justification was that men pull woman's weight for herexample man pull up into helicopter with his combat gear on and then lift woman into helo all she has to do is hold on i only knew three wms (women marines) who pull their own weight

what helped me change my relationship to food was intermittent fasting sure plenty of people binge eat into surplus during their window but for me it was huge to train my brain not to he eating all day every day now that hunger and craving signal doesn't even come on until lunch and it doesn't come on strong i eat plate of eggs for lunch (like 300 calories and 25g protein) and then don't get hungry until dinner where i finally have very large meal i eat my protein and fiber first at meal and can never seem to finish carbs because of that i don't even cook carbs sometimes knowing i'm not going to eat them and rather just eat more meat anyways also yogurt is excellent snack sure it's full of sugar but if you use it to replace actual just sugary empty calories then you're at least getting some protein and vitamins while you succumb to your sugar cravingshonestly eat as much protein as you can stomach and there won't be much room for too many calories i'm stuffed for hours after five eggs and it's 350 calories if you need to bulk up your meals pick whatever green veggies you like i love broccoli and can eat lot of it trick is don't be afraid to add some fatoil to nutritious foods they'll taste much better and you're still getting their nutrients with essential fatty acid boost

i believe fat people think that food they eat is more satisfying and tasty than eating healthily and eating healthily means eating food they don’t like or even find disgusting but eating healthily is more tasty more fun makes you feel better and satisfy you because you’re getting nutrients you need it gives you more energy to put that mental effort into choosing healthy work out how you can make eating healthily part of every day and eventually everything you eat we are so lucky to have internet that makes it easy to find healthy tasty and quick recipes also have one or two easy fall-back meals for when you can’t be bothered to choose for me that is chicken rice and broccoli (swap out broccoli) for whatever vegetable you like if you don’t like broccoli
haven't seen movie haven't really been interested but now you have made me curious from what you have shared it seems like it is pretty accurate description of what you can expect if you become extremely obese i always have to remind myself that "phobia" doesn't just mean abnormal fear of something but also abnormal repulsion there is nothing abnormal about fearing effects of obesity and depression and nothing abnormal about repulsion towards someone killing themselves now those who simply look at overweight non-ideal body and say "eww gross exclamation_symbol " simply because it's not pleasing to their eyes they are fat phobic but i daresay they are also in minority most people look with empathy and understanding concerned for well being of othersi really enjoyed your insights on how food cultureindustry of us is affecting our health i used to live in city with wide variety of restaurants everywhere and now live in rural area where aside from half dozen or so fast food joints (most of which i loathe) there are even less restaurants that have food that even rarely appeals to me those facts have not stopped me from picking up food at least for my husband once or twice week we live outside delivery area for pizza and afaik door dash doesn't reach us and i've never really thought about how we should be grateful for that instead of being annoyed that we have to get fully dressed leave our home and drive 30 minutes to grab junk
you should definitely apologize for being yourself especially if you are like that and are so fat you start to generate your own gravitational feild

like some other people below say mental health aspect is so important i was having rough patch last 2 years with toxic relationships eventual suicidal ideations even losing hope in life going out from that hole made things so much easier feeling loved and accepted for who i was even with weight i put on because of binge eating having more activities to do it all helped so much i still find myself skipping meals sometimes accidentally sometimes because i'm sometimes afraid to start eating for day- i know i have more way to go still feeling guilty over eating "too much" for having piece of chocolate worrying if i trigger myself into binge just ate praline drank cup of tea and hey i'm not binging ) idk it's just so good not to be that bloated self
this is one of most eye-opening and impactful videos i've ever seen - i think its so easy to give in to quick calorie foods but recognising incredible value of low calorie to high nutrition ratio foods in improving all aspects of your health (strength immune system brain function etc) and literally extending your lifespan completely changes how i think of food now thank you so much kiana for creating these amazingly informative and brilliantly designed videos exclamation_symbol

god i used to be so miserable when i worked in hospitality it was my worst nightmare i worked as barista in small family owned specialty coffee chain and they lived by 'the customer is always right' their big thing was to never ask customers to leave even after closing in summer we had beautiful tables on tall building's terrace overlooking city and it was so nice at night our business hours were 8am-10pm but strict company policy was to never ever kick guests out they'd let them sit outside until 11-12pm before very gently telling them we closed two hours ago we not get paid overtime and on top of that there was 30 more minutes of work to be done after last customers leave for closing place was located in extremely boujee neighborhood and people were very affluent and so incredibly entitled and abused company policy to fullest only to leave $1 tip for three people who stayed well into night to accommodate them it was worst two years of my life working there i was so unhappy i hated our regulars from bottom of my heart dirty rich zero manners never tipped talking about how they're cleaning their ex wives in divorces and sleeping with teenaged girls there was one regular who had six sons by like 5 different wives he come in with them and his little ipad order single americano (no tip) and leave his six kids to terrorize staff who had to keep them entertained (the youngest was maybe 18 months) and everyone had to suck it up because he was friends with owners when he was bored of his stupid offspring he'd bring them to us to babysit for free never ordered single drinkjuicefood for kids i literally walk up to table without saying hello or smiling and just asking what can i get you no hello no goodbye that job sucked life out of me i quit two years ago and i genuinely feel like i'm still carrying that fatigue and stress in my bones

there is similar docureality series as 600 lb life of british origin called fat doctorsome episodes of it is on you tube that series not as intrusive to people recieving surgery but they are interviewed in depth and one can notice they have already done some amount of mental and intellectual scrutinizing about their weight as to when why and whats around their weight and they also interview doctors more and also show more of medical procedure as such which some perhaps find "gory" in some of episodes where it's not blurred out but to some it be worth to see fat aprons they need to get by to get to stomach pouch covering but put burden on organs this especially since some fat tokers try to argue that visceral doesn't exist (but even skinny people can have it)

@420 i agree with everything you say except for "personal choices" rhetoric in ideal world yes our outcomes in life be complete result of our choices but in society as it is structured today (capitalism etc) most people are stuck within boundaries set by genetics and socioeconomic status hence reason some of poorest countries are most obese i 100 percentage_symbol agree people should put all effort into self improvement but it is usually only exceptional ones who will break free of their boundaries for best results we need societal level changes

im bit overweight and so i stopped eating all but maybe 300 to 500 calories day and worked out 4 to 5x week and not lose 1 single pound it wasnt till i started eating properly that i started losing weight
yooo im so glad i came across this video because i was one of those young girls (i’m 18) who literally thought unless i looked like kim kardahsian i wasn’t worth anything i have to be curvy and have beat face and don’t worry about my character or personality because everyone seems so shallow so it won’t matter anyway but i think that’s exactly what social media wants us to belvie it wants us to be caught up in this u realistic world where we post best picture and have best lighting and best aesthetically pleasing morning routine it took me forever it feels like to debunk all these things and it took me deleteing instagram and tik tok and youtube and literally having no social media and just focusing on my life because my life is not aesthetic i live in two bedroom trailer with 5 other people and i sleep on mat on floor because i’m poor i dont have penthouse or expensive car i can’t afford to get starbucks everyday but i thought if i wasn’t living socialmedia life i was useless i enjoy my life because of my life i’m able to appreciate things that many others can’t jesus is building character in me that is unbreakable and i can sit and pout and feel like i’m worthless but that doesn’t get me anywhere but suicidal ( believe me i’ve been there) i’ve learned to take care of myself not just look like i take care of my self but actually do it and i’m gonna let you in on little secret taking care of yourself or “self care” isn’t getting your nails done every week or having 10 steps skincare routine these are things that you can do for self care butttt big butt taking care of yourself is doing things you hate doing like budgeting your money and not spending it all on stuff that’s not necessity taking care of yourself learning to be disciplined saying no to yourself taking care of yourself is also taking care of your community your loved ones but nobody really wants to show reality because why anyone want to see reality that’s why most poeple don’t accept jesus because he is light and darkness hates light just like criminals hate police officer just like us using our insecurities but i determined to shed light on real life to show ugly so people can see what real life looks like so these kids can stop growing up thinking life is just big fun party with no real responsibilities i’m sooo glad you made this video thanks red_heart

ego vs intuition basically discipline ego basically what answer every religion and philosophist came too i'm glad people are noticing spirituality and such more just sad people are only now realizing it to come too surface people needing guidance remember lots of answer within meditation eating healthy anything that heighten intuition not ego there's reason christianity says we go to hell for indulging in cravings murder and so on but read it more metaphorically ego gets stronger whenever we feed it ego then suffers more reason why they use term "hell" if people read everything metaphorically you'll notice lot of religionsway of life like buddhism hinduism christianity etc they were all talking about higher cosnciousness basically feeding intuition insteaddisciplining ego we knew it for 1000's of years most people just take religion too literally but really there's lot to learn about how psychè and ego works in mostly hinduism and buddhism christianity has been changed lot for propaganda purposes but old testament teaches more about it new one is bit more materialistic reason why some christians these days are waay too karen anyway if you don't feel like reading any religion you also check out carl jung he talks lot about shadow work and founded analytical psychology he's also one who studied unconscious state and so fourth like four archetypes like self persona shadow and animaanimus shadow being everything about yourself you don't see as positive and animaanimus which is masculine and feminine side anima is man's internal other feminine animus on other hand is woman's internal other masculine balancing both can help you in creating stability like courage and on other side empathy lots of people these days are unbalanced either too fragile or too aggressive lots of it can stem from parents splitting up not having fathermother figure it can also stem from lots of processed food which is known to decrease testosterone in men not sure about women aggressiveness can also stem from too huge of ego something that alcohol increases which is why so many are depressed when drinking it all connects there's reason why religion looks down on alcohol and such psychedelics work other way diminishing ego helps you see world clearer without emotional fog and so on reason why psychedelics have helped so many people with addiction ego is what is addicted psychedelics also rewrites thought patterns making it easier to write healthy new one philosophy and religion always knew about it christianity just have muddied whole picture of what religion is hinduism and buddhism teaches about you how to overcome your mindego and live happy life all based on psychology and spirituality what people get wrong is that spirituality is about believing something that isn't real yes christianity says this but spirituality is about reaching your higher self disciplining your ego and showing love and empathy which is all what intuition is about sure religion can be stories but hinduism and buddhism is way of life yes it does have stories but most read it literally and metaphorically example gods in hinduism all tells story gods are based on love death ego and so fourth reading through lines will make you understand "gods" are just metaphors for different emotions you have stories deepening your understanding of these emotions i'm not religious i was atheist but now theist i've studied all of them and see similarities in all of them so i see how every religion can help you i do believe every "god" people have seen has been under influence of psychedelics though and that every god is same entity just people having different viewpoints on what higher power should look like are you christian and take mushrooms well you as well see jesus or something i'm saying besides "gods" there are actual knowledge to living better life i do believe there's something higher but what i don't know all i know is that people has known how to live spiritual happy life centuries ago so there must be something giving them knowledge people have been known to have psychedelic experiences where they've been shown what happiness is and how to live by it easily said ego is what suffers enjoy little things have positive life but also disciplined one comfort is what ruins us this was really long but yeah it's all my knowledge though years connecting psychology psychedelics and religionspiritualitybeing uncomfortable also increases dopamine and other chemicals like norepinephrine which is why people do yoga ice baths meditation on spike mats and feel way better afterwards you should check out channels like sky life seek discomfort and yes theory they all got different examples of exposing yourself to uncomfortable things )
one thing about binge eating for me was that i felt like i had to rush my meals i grew up being asked to hurry up and cram my mouth with heaps of rice so i be allowed to leave dining table as adult i had developed this habit well until last year when i learnt to slow down and take my time not only does it help me be aware of how full i am it also reminds me to actually taste my food another thing that i learnt by doing that was how salty my meals actually were i was stuffing myself with so much carbs and msg (think rice thick sauces and deep fried dishes) now i try to eat cleaner and it has reduced that heavy bloated feeling and i feel that this small habit has made such huge change in my eatingdiet mindset

i'd say i'm liberally republican i believe in republican values but i also share some sentiments with true liberals (to clarify non-radical) we need strong basis for country but there does need to be some change in system about little things to appease people such as legalizing weed and giving back rights to certain freedoms we have been restrained from such as "fighting words" basis

as person who was dealing with anorexia and bulimia i feel offended what she did felt like mockery like telling me "anyone can be anorexic it's made-up problem" i was afraid to show my body in public i was anxious while eating food fat stigma i've experienced was hanging over me even when i was under 47g at 176m i doubt that she ever had anorexia because nobody who went through this shit make up stuff like thatthere is so much she be so much she could've done for body-acceptance movements and yet she is choosing to go after fame attention and spreading misinformation

it doesn’t seem like you really understand psychology of being overweight person or what body positivity is (though as well as some obese people you show in your videos) your channel looks like you are just one of those fat shaming people who don’t understand that talking about health consequences is not helping at all what helps these people is not just things like “stop eating” “move more” or “pull yourself together and just do it” but love and supporting environment activities they actually like doing good therapist respectful attitude supporting family etc because food addiction always has something to do with guilt stress coping eating up emotions because of inability to deal with them childhood traumas and low self esteem and other “benefits” from being overweight for our brain if i were you i’d rather stop just shaming fat people or do superiority talk on how you were overweight and point out other real side of problem why people get obese and why fat activist became what it is today

ive started watching this show on youtube recently and had to stop they had little segments in between that were painful to watch and put unhealthy thoughts into my head they had segments focusing on anorexia and right after have segments of perfectly healthy normal looking woman doing everything she can to get 'quick fix' solutions to acheive body shape she wanted she'd talk about her flabby tummy and 'rotund belly' without even morsel of pudge on her going from workout place to workout place even doing laser lipo treatments exclamation_symbol so on one hand it's 'quick fix weightloss is bad' and then on other 'here's some quick fix weight loss tips exclamation_symbol ' i found myself kind of obsessing over people with eds and what they do to lose weight paying hyper attention to superskinnies putting that in my youtube algorithm is actually what made your videos start showing up n my feed so in way im grateful but yeah i can't watch that show anymore exclamation_symbol

i just wanna follow up on my previous comment (and again i realize i'm talking about being too skinny buti think this applies because)my parents always tried to force me to eat and then gave in when i refused or sent me to bed as kid or say they'd take something away and i wanted bed that night anywaythings actually changed when they offered me dinner and it was optional i eat my frozen mealor if i like what they were cooking i join them andit was totally my choice eventually in this environment this was when i decided it wouldn't hurt (in fact it help) to join them once or twice week since my dad always cooks freshor at least healthier than what i eat optionsthe fat kids need that offer chance thankfully my parents did eventually realize keeping me at table wasn't answer they set "deals" for me as child and as adult they always ask how much i will actually eat (and i eat any leftovers next day)this seems nuts but i used to be able see my ribs (slightly i wasn't starving) now i have actual belly that jiggles little bit)but if only these kids parents offer their kids option or i guess in this caselet kids offer them option exclamation_symbol my dad is cook in house but he did give us chances and while me and my youngest brother blew ours my middle brother actually does cook for our dad and even sometimes gets honor of being his sous chef to be fair though my dad does let me make green bean casserole for thanksgiving (he always browns fries onions little too much and for some reason that dish is one of two dishes i can totally nail)
only thing bigger than amount of evidence for obesity being dangerous is size of asses of people who push that narrative
i have found closer with my mom i get more reckless and impulsive i get closer with my dad i get i’m reminded to be thankful and have manners and try and be nice and patient my dads always hugged me and loved me in public and he’s pushed me to make friends and work and do good at school he listens to my choir music and asks about my day every day and i’m sure that really started to pay off when i started to ask him about his too i’d come down to his home office sometimes and ask if i help him with work haha good fathers are sooo needed i’d lose my head if i only had my mom i’d be terrible human tbh

i actually disagree with lot of this filters aside these women these girls are crying over are putting in work these girls are not putting in they have their hair done they have their makeup on they're watching their nutrition they're working out they're dressing carefully and - yes - they're probably under filter or two these girls are just crying they're not even wearing any makeup i'm not saying women must wear makeup to be beautiful but if you want to look like women wearing tons of makeup you're going to have to put some on even they don't look way they do wearing makeup when they're not wearing makeup you're not going to get same results if you're not putting in any of effort most blatant example significantly overweight girl in opening hugging herself as audio plays something like "i wish i knew what it was like to be seen as beautiful" fix your nutrition that's all you no don't run off half-cocked develop eating disorder recover and come back claiming all nutrition management efforts are toxic diet culture do it right you can't expect same results when you're not putting in same efforts aspirational is but should not be four letter word either legitimately strive - no crash diets shortcuts or other bullshit - to be what you want to be or accept how you are without insisting others do too sorry bp - body positivity - obesity will never cute for example lets stop this headlong run for "harrison bergeron"-style society

ayo i don’t mean to force anything on anyone but we have various types of evidence for biblical events if anyone is interested read onnote i can’t prove god to you it all comes down to your choice to put your trust in jesus christ that’s all faith is-trust unfortunately in these recent years science and “religion” (as we know them today) have bastardized each other and themselves point is faith is trusting in jesus it’s not blind jump into what people deem “irrational” billy graham said something reminiscent of that i have no power over you i can only tell you but i can’t force you (i mean we’re conversing online lol i’m not at your location… yet)james 48 “draw near to god and he will draw near to you cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded”hebrews 116 “and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him”check out “holylandsite cold-case christianity delafé testimonies” there be more but those are ones i know ofreligion (christianity) is just relationship with god along with loving others (see james 127)now onto evidence exclamation_symbol exclamation_symbol here's one example scientists have discovered that earth "skipped" daythe bible explains how that happened in book of joshua joshua asked sun to stop so he and israelites defeat their enemies then in 2 kings king hezekiah learned he was dying and pleaded to god to not let him die god sent prophet to king hezekiah who said hezekiah live hezekiah wanted sign and that be for sun to defy law of inertia and go back 10 degrees nasa confirmed all this and did math (look it up for more info)we also found noah’s ark hanging out in turkey along with anchor stones marked with crosses signifying that it’s revered place along with altars and many other related findings look it up it’s good stuff (holylandsite)more evidence for bible concerning cosmology and divine revelation in job 267 proverbs 827 isaiah 4022 (read on)the idea that earth was round can be dated back to 600 bc in greece it was more widely accepted around 3rd century (300 bc-201 bc) idea that earth floated in space was concocted circa 500 bc note time was “labeled” differently back then for example year 3000 year 420 year 69 year 0 year 1 year 2… and so on job 267 “ he [god] hangs earth on nothing” book of job was supposedly written at 2100 bcproverbs 827 “ when he drew circle on face of deep ” proverbs was possibly written between 970 and 686 bcisaiah 4022 “it is he who sits above circles of earth ” isaiah was written between 739 and 680 bcthis one doesn’t pertain to cosmology but it refers to divine revelation nonetheless so you know how euphrates river is drying up question_symbol well guess what question_symbol people in bible are saying “been there done that” read on to learn moreisaiah 1115 “the lord will dry up gulf of egyptian sea with scorching wind he will sweep his hand over euphrates river he will break it up into seven streams so that anyone can cross over in sandals” revelation 1612 “the sixth angel poured out his bowl on great river euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare way for kings from east”how did they know about this question_symbol you tell me my fellow zoomerznow for evidence outside biblethe holy spirit exists i was suicidal for 9-ish months but then i read john 316 and poof- big sad went away in one nightalso look up john gabbana's (boonk gang) testimony dude did lot of wacky stuff he's changed nowcheck out “delafé testimonies” they got some good stuff as wellyou cannot deny work god does in people’s livesalso soul exists someone i know (i won't say who- privacy reasons) saw their soul leaving their body like pulling off band-aid except it doesn't hurtthere are also non-christian sources who have confirmed existence and divinity of jesus some of which were hostile towards christianity such asthallus (52 ad) who said jesus lived was crucified and confirmed darkness and earthquake that followed christ’s crucifixion tacitus (56-120 ad) who called followers of christ “christians” confirmed that jesus was crucified under pontus pilate’s commandtalmud (400-700 ad) confirmed that disciples were martyred for their faith and confirmed jesus was executed day before passover and said jesus had “magical” powerspliny younger (61-113 ad) who said that christians thought jesus wasis god in flesh (god son)phlegon (80-140 ad) who said jesus had ability to predict future and confirmed that jesus was crucified during caesar’s reign confirmed jesus rose from dead and confirmed he showed his wounds to confirm he was crucifiedcelcus (175 ad) who said jesus was born of virgin said his father is carpenter and confirmed jesus had miraculous powers(see cold-case christianity for more details)here’s physical evidence of jesus and his resurrection1) no persecution have started if he hadn’t come back (even disciples thought jesus never make ultimate comeback)2) roman soldiers have paid with their lives if they failed at their jobs3) there was 2-4 ton rock that 11-12 guys have to move (the disciples deserted him remember question_symbol they didn’t have any help everyone said “crucify him exclamation_symbol ” major l to those opposed to jesus)4) there was roman seal which was metal pin that sealed tomb stone (they have to break that off there were well-trained roman guards there as well) 5) stealing jesus’s body isn’t something disciples do (besides judas although he hung himself after feeling remorse for betraying jesus)6) disciples wouldn’t die for what they knew be lie (the lie being jesus never made ultimate comeback they were called to not be liars i mean they hung out with son of godgod in flesh come on now)faith science and reason people (as we all know them today and as it was before all those things were tarnished)brothers what have we done look at us look at

kiana your statement about protein 001126 "proteins is by far most" 1 gram of carbs has four calories 1 gram of protein has four calories but 1 gram of fat has nine calories more than twice that of protein

"by intentionally losing weight you are erasing potentially fat body" - "and by intentionally gaining weight you are erasing potentially normal body"
i want to lose weight is because i was always obese as child until i got to middle school and decided i needed to become healthy after hitting 195lbs at 11 years oldi'm back to being that weight pretty much and although i don't look as fat i hate what i've made my body become i hate that over last year and half i've gained just about 40lbs i hate that i was only slowly gaining weight after my anorexia from 105 to 125 i've slowly went from that to 135 then 145 then 150 then my weight sky-rocketed junior yearjunior year wasn't tough year i was just overeating bc i didn't want to tell my family i wasn't vegan anymore so i eat and eat and eat while i was at school during breakfast during lunch and break and even at work i hate it

freedom of speech grown up
lot of people think that it's easier to lose weight and eat healthier by eating certain foods and "limiting" junk food but i have personally found that it's easier to have at least general plan for what to eat each day and track all food it leads me to make food choices based on whether it is worth calories both by nutrition and taste (both are important) evidence that this worked for me i lost 70 lbs from 265 to 195 at 6'4" i did not exercise in any way during this period although i definitely should have after i lost weight i started lifting weights and doing cardio few times per week and gained back another 25 lbs of lean mass (muscle water glycogen) over year and half and actually managed to lose more fat mass do with this anecdote what you will but perhaps it will help someone realize there is approach between trying to make better choices in moment and complete meal planning

here's unfortunate fact 1 lb fat in body can be processed into 3500 calories so if you were to lose 69 lb fat in 2 weeks you need to eat nothing and burn over 17000 calories per day even michael phelps or tour de france racers don't burn that much
it always saddens me when people talk about glycemic index but not glycemic load exclamation_symbol glycemic index is calculated based on 50g of carbohydrates for all foods with raw carrots for example one entire pound of carrots is only 45g of carbs so to get gi measurement they accounted for more than entire pound of carrots what's last time you sat down to meal of more than whole pound of carrots question_symbol glycemic load takes serving sizes into account so for glycemic load they take measurement based on 2 small raw carrots for example rather than over pound of carrots gi is still good metric to look at but it doesn't give accurate picture because it doesn't factor in realistic serving sizes

kim said it herself that kylies products suck lol'
she probably has eating disorder but definitely not anorexia i'd say she probably has binge eating disorder where she can't control how much she eats binge-eating disorder is condition where people lose control of their eating and have reoccurring episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food unlike bulimia periods of binge eating are not followed by purging excessive exercise or fasting as result people with binge eating disorders are often overweight or obese i heard her say at 335 (roughly) that she won't eat all day and then binge at night which is common in binge eating disorder and bulimia so imo it's not anorexia but probably another ed
i’m recovering alcoholic and because i drank my calories i have very complicated relationship with food idea of being addicted to eating something you have to do to stay alive is really scary because i know what it feels like to think you need your substance food addicts need to eat like anyone else if i had to take couple shots every day i never stop drinking i’m trying really hard to unlearn my judgement of overweight people genetics and science of fattening food has lot to do with it but i also remember how i felt when i drank thousands of calories of whiskey week world is scary and sucks and it’s getting worse and we all cope in different ways

interesting - as t1d since 1972 aspartame was pretty much forced on me if i wanted diet soda like tab at time as i got older i heard rumors and various discussions about aspartame that it causes cancer only in super high doses and some have allergic-like reactions those same rumors were around with saccharin too which was also one of only options available for those like me today nutrasweet is stevia and erythritol blend using "rebaudioside m" component of stevia that is supposedly sweeter and less bitter personally i'm not huge fan of flavor of stevia and erythritol gets tricky with weird cooling sensation in some recipes and amounts i can say aspartame being one of few sweeteners i was able to take advantage of so long ago (and is still in some diet sodas) i've never knowingly had any issues or concerns with blood sugar impact being my primary concern today while i do still drink lots of zero-sugar stuff like pepsi 7up etc i prefer to use allulose in almost everything i cook if dish needs to be sweet really great job with research details and walkthrough thank you for putting this out there exclamation_symbol

hello thanks for your amazing work red_heartat 35 years old and as former bulimic binge eater emotional eater i agree with what you said in this videothe importance of sleep is so neglected i can tell that good sleeping totally changes whole f game with hunger and mood thoughout day nearly one year now that i go to bed at 1030 pm and wake up at 7 am more or less i feel less anxious and i can eat peacefully my first meal at 1pm i'm not hungry at all in morning eating in morning makes me feel bad and nauseous which allows me to experiment intermittent fasting allowing my digestive system to rest and it's soothing my mindwhile i was searching for tips to stop bingeating nice advice bit bisturbing at beginning was "having full nice meal" good plate one that allows you to feel you've eaten well (a nice way to eat loooot of vegetables) without shame and it worked for me no need to throw back my meals anymore no need to worry about blowing fuse anymore and open fridge and food storage and make carnage anymore i'd rather eat big plate than eating all day longi don't eat lot of white sugar cakes and sweets anymore just from time to time and they taste now so nasty i eat very dark chocolate one or two biscuits with my coffee for lunch and one after my dinner with my herbal spiced infusion or green teadrink lot coffee or tea in morning green tea and natural organic infusions (no flavors no artificial flavors) i recommend pukka ones or yogi tea and watervegetal food helped me lot not that i don't want to eat meat but i don't see point in putting bad quality meat in my body poor earthling suffered his life long and in end industry adds flavors and sugars salt and coloring and conservative additives and "spice extracts" (not even just spice no spice extractsflushed_face) etc from time to time i eat good quality meat when i find some organic local eggs and fresh goat cheese are delicous tooexercising also helped me lot to have feeling of clarified mind wich was very sweet and agreable less pain satisfaction of evolving and succeeding in doing stuff that you weren't able to do before feeling your blood circling fast all inside instead of watching tv or being depressed in your bed stretching blisssmall habits helps washing my teeth when i'm done eating helped me too it means "eating is over" and i just go and do something else reading drawing painting working and it's satisfiying to focus on something without interrupting yourself with pulse go to f fridge and again start eating like there's no tomorrowreading labels food composition is reflex now and when i see that list is long with added sugar and useless stuff where there should'nt be i don't buy product and i don't miss it at all i hope you american friends are able to find healthy stuff not expensive as f and not polluted as fnow i tell myself that i experimented fast and junk food and normal food too in waaaaaaay tooo enormous amounts well enough and now it's time to just eat simple stuff and that's delicious and healthyi also told myself that wasting all of my money on so many food was insane it lasted about 12 years flushed_facemy throat that began to hurt all time my nasty breath and horrible stomach pain day after worried me and disgusted me of what i was inflicting to my body mind soul etcthe last time dentist told me that my teeth were quite used for my agemy liver hurting strangely (a kind of strange pain and heavy weight on right side of bust and caracteristic breath that comes with liver problems so good red_heart) also helped me realize and being aware (being aware and conscious also is very very important) that i die sooner than scheduled in atrocious paini can say that i'm done with binge eating or throwing back my food losing weight was my goal when this nightmare began to intensify now my weight is stable even if i am just little overweight it doesn't matter food is still important to me but i'm not obsessed anymore and from time to time i eat half pizza or ice cream with delight and that's ok no shame no guilt no nothing i'm done i'm in f peacei wish to all of you that struggle everyday with this s to get out of it to find your way out of dark it's possible it's sometimes messy as f but in end it works and you'll be f proud that this s is far behind be strong flexed_biceps you can do it you deserve peace

children are conditioned into eating certain foods there will be some foods child dislikes but in general if you give them balanced diet they will eat what they are told to fast food is treat not diet my children were sent to bed without pudding if they didn’t eat their dinner i didn’t fry food it was either baked boiled or steamed for their drink during meal it was either apple juice orange juice or milk otherwise or they have squash or water trust me when i say child will not allow itself to starve if presented with healthy tasty food giving your child fast food as staple diet is cop out by parent you get out what you put in
not sure where this falls in whole self-deception or secret eating category but i have trouble losing weight due to psych issues i had complete mental breakdown and lost ton of weight unhealthy amount in fact i had to be forced to eat now that i’ve recovered i’m obese every time i try to lose weight and start seeing results i self sabotage because being thin in my mind equates to being “sick” i haven’t managed to break through that psychological barrier yet no obese-related health scare has hit hard enough to overpower that initial belief

according to me body positivity is not mocking someone for hisher looks- height weight hair etc every obese person knows that she is fat and need to weight loss but for some people losing weight is tough maybe because of thyroid pcod or other disease we need to be supportive and empathetic to them but some people misunderstand body positivity and thinks that being fat is fine no it is not your body is temple and start worshipping it otherwise we cant adapt tha changing climate

as 14 year old girl that lost 20kg (from 80-60) in last 45 months i find your videos be very helpfull i sadly found your channel after i already got my stuff together it started because i was doing research and project on personality that helped me become more open minded and started analyzing my behavior- i found out that my over eating stemmed from fact that i was just sadbored and playing video games all day luckily this “enlightening “ happened just before summer break so i put my full effort into loosing weight i first started with getting myself busy and being productive ( i personally feel lot happier and emotionally “satiated” when i’ve had productive day and can go exhausted to bed) so i was helping my dad construct our house all time except when i had to eat (switched my old stuff for low calorie high volume food ) and also i started playing tennis every other day so i had 700-900 active calories daily when school started it first didn’t really impact me just switched out construction work to studying more (sadly my active calories droppedcrying_face) but i’ve recently had little bump in road- i got sick so no tennis but this was still ok cause i was putting all my energy this week into biology seminar next week i went to school but still no tennis but still working on seminar but i started eating really poorly for like 3 weeks and gained 2 kg but i got it under control and already lost those 2kg back also i started going to gym with my friend half week ago ( i think it’s gonna substitute tennis because it’s getting cold and tennis is really expensive tbh and i don’t think i can suport tennis gym and getting good grades and placing in competitions )

holy crap i am type 1 diabetic and i didn't know that it's actually endocrinology why i see my blood sugar tank when i'm cooking meal i'm really anticipating and i'm "starving" by time i finally sit down i've learned to be careful not to overeat on accident i'm one of those people i guess i have continuous glucose monitor and it's been wild watching patterns over last three years after drastically changing my lifestyle let's just say i took my a1c from 10 to 60 my other stat i'm proud of is going from 260 lbs to 180 and still going i'm also frankly disappointed in my care team for never giving me half as much information as was contained in this video i had to figure out that high glycemic index foods spike my blood sugar myself and do research on what foods wouldn't on my own i got there eventually i'm just glad i'm healthier now at 35 than i was at 25 winking_face thanks for letting me toot my horn little genuinely fantastic video exclamation_symbol
it's same thing for people who are underweight anorexic too many of them will say "i'm healthy" or "it's lifestyle" or even "i'm not underweight"-- or worse "i'm fat exclamation_symbol " they don't believe they're withering away they believe they're most obese person in room eating disorders are all like that based in self-deception and delusion it's also just like food addiction only on opposite end of spectrum instead of lying to others that they're on diet anorexic nervosa patients will lie that they did eat and they'll lie to you me their parents their doctors everyone real question is how does one even talk to someone who is delusional (whether they're deluded into not believing their overweight or underweight) question_symbol how does one get them to see that they're severely underweight that they need help or that they can die at any moment because of it question_symbol i don't know answer all i know is that it's sad for many addicts that recover sometimes it's not even matter of hitting "rock bottom" they say that addicts will change when they want to change so how can we even begin to help anorexic or obese people see their unhealthiness question_symbol delusions are just that-- no amount of data or proof will undo delusion person themself will have to be one to overcome it i don't know one person on this planet that knows how to hurry up that "overcome delusion" process though in order to save lives

lot of these fat acceptance people take half of fact they kinda heard and run with it like being super lean 247 is unsustainable for most people because to do that you either have to be on tren or in calorie deficit both of which will cause health problems if continued for long period of time it is healthy to have some fat on you however healthy range is 18-30 percentage_symbol depending on gender and genetics (some peoples bodies just work different though between 25 and 30 percentage_symbol can still be healthy so long as ur eating healthy drinking enough water and exercising enough clean bulks aren’t gonna cause any significant health problems) there is point when it’s too much or how lot of them say that 90 percentage_symbol of time dieting doesn’t work (i’ve heard eating healthy at all doesn’t work too and that person is gonna die) which is true in reference to fad diets and changing your entire diet cold turkey making slow and gradual changes finding healthy recipes you enjoy not being super restrictive and meal prepping at least one meal every week is key to long term success reason why fad diets don’t work is because people who do them don’t understand nutrition and will just go back to eating how they used to after they’ve lost all weight reason why cold turkey doesn’t work is because it leads to burnout it’s same reason being super restrictive doesn’t work and on people it does it also borders on disordered eating and often there’s correlation with unhealthy relationship with food (im not talking about athletes or something temporarily being super restrictive before like weigh in or show or something im talking about instagram “nutritionists” who are like “you can’t eat bread seed oil meat vegetables water milk ect” they’re also same ones who drink bleach because they believe it gives them health benefits basically jilly juice mfs)

instead of traditional pasta dishes i make grilled chicken bits with spicy seasoning and mix of veggies with some corn and then fraction of serving of pearled couscous and mix it together pasta (couscous) makes up very small amount of overall food and paired with small amount of corn it is very filling other veggies (broccoli carrots peppers etc) and chicken make up most of dish i use little canola oil and occasionally tablespoon of butter total in amount that has 2-3 servings not perfect dish for health but quite healthy especially compared with large plate of spaghetti or whatever you be indulging in too frequently high in protein low in refined carbs (comparatively with other pasta dishes) and fairly high amount of fiber depending on how many veggies you use but it not satiate your hunger as much if you are pounding refined carbs and junk food throughout day if you are being pretty healthy throughout day this is great meal
